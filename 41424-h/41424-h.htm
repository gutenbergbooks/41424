"xd21e1401src" href="#xd21e1401" name="xd21e1401src">1</a>&mdash;The
occupational shepherd caste of northern India. The name is derived from
the Hindi <i>g&#257;dar</i> and the Sanskrit <i>gandh&#257;ra</i>, a
sheep, the Sanskrit name being taken from the country of Gandh&#257;ra
or Kandah&#257;r, from which sheep were first brought. The three main
shepherd castes all have functional names, that of the Dhangars or
Mar&#257;tha shepherds being derived from <i>dhan</i>, small stock,
while the Kuramw&#257;rs or Telugu shepherds take their name like the
Gadarias from <i>kuruba</i>, a sheep. These three castes are of similar
nature and status, and differ only in language and local customs. In
1911 the Gadarias numbered 41,000 persons. They are found in the
northern Districts, and appear to have been amongst the earliest
settlers in the Nerbudda valley, for they have given their name to
several villages, as Gadariakheda and G&#257;darw&#257;ra.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Subdivisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gadarias are a very mixed caste. They themselves
say that their first ancestor was created by Mah&#257;deo to tend his
rams, and that he married three women who were fascinated by the sight
of him shearing the sheep. These belonged to the Br&#257;hman,
Dh&#299;mar and Barai castes respectively, and became the ancestors of
the Nikhar, Dhengar and Barmaiyan subcastes of Gadarias. The Nikhar
subcaste are the highest, their name meaning pure. Dhengar is probably,
in reality, a corruption of Dhangar, the name of the Mar&#257;tha
shepherd <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>caste. They have other subdivisions of the common
territorial type, as Jheria or jungly, applied to the Gadarias of
Chhatt&#299;sgarh; Desha from <i>desh</i>, country, meaning those who
came from northern India; Purvaiya or eastern, applied to immigrants
from Oudh; and M&#257;lvi or those belonging to M&#257;lwa. Nikhar and
Dhengar men take food together, but not the women; and if a marriage
cannot be otherwise arranged these subcastes will sometimes give
daughters to each other. A girl thus married is no longer permitted to
take food at her father&rsquo;s house, but she may eat with the women
of her husband&rsquo;s subcaste. Many of their exogamous groups are
named after animals or plants, as Hiranw&#257;r, from <i>hiran</i>, a
deer; Sapha from the cobra, Moria from the peacock, N&#257;har from the
tiger, Phulsungha, a flower, and so on. Others are the names of
R&#257;jp&#363;t septs and of other castes, as Ahirw&#257;r (Ah&#299;r)
and Bamhania (Br&#257;hman).</p>
<p>Another more ambitious legend derives their origin from the Bania
caste. They say that once a Bania was walking along the road with a
cocoanut in his hand when Vishnu met him and asked him what it was. The
Bania answered that it was a cocoanut. Vishnu said that it was not a
cocoanut but wool, and told him to break it, and on breaking the
cocoanut the Bania found that it was filled with wool. The Bania asked
what he should do with it, and Vishnu told him to make a blanket out of
it for the god to sit on. So he made a blanket, and Vishnu said that
from that day he should be the ancestor of the Gadaria caste, and earn
his bread by making blankets from the wool of sheep. The Bania asked
where he should get the sheep from, and the god told him to go home
saying &lsquo;<i>Eh&#257;n, Eh&#257;n, Eh&#257;n</i>,&rsquo; all the
way, and when he got home he would find a flock of sheep following him;
but he was not to look behind him all the way. And the Bania did so,
but when he had almost got home he could not help looking behind him to
see if there were really any sheep. And he saw a long line of sheep
following him in single file, and at the very end was a ram with golden
horns just rising out of the ground. But as he looked it sank back
again into the ground, and he went back to Vishnu and begged for it,
but Vishnu said that as he had looked behind him he had lost it. And
this was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>the origin of the Gadaria caste, and the Gadarias
always say &lsquo;<i>Eh&#257;n, Eh&#257;n</i>,&rsquo; as they lead
their flocks of sheep and goats to pasture.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Marriage customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage within the clan is forbidden and also the
union of first cousins. Girls may be married at any age, and are
sometimes united to husbands much younger than themselves. Four
castemen of standing carry the proposal of marriage from the
boy&rsquo;s father, and the girl&rsquo;s father, being forewarned,
sends others to meet them. One of the ambassadors opens the
conversation by saying, &lsquo;We have the milk and you have the
milk-pail; let them be joined.&rsquo; To which the girl&rsquo;s party,
if the match be agreeable, will reply, &ldquo;Yes, we have the tamarind
and you have the mango; if the <i>panches</i> agree let there be a
marriage.&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s father gives the girl&rsquo;s father
five areca-nuts, and the latter returns them and they clasp each other
round the neck. When the wedding procession reaches the bride&rsquo;s
village it is met by their party, and one of them takes the
<i>sarota</i> or iron nut-cutter, which the bridegroom holds in his
hand, and twirls it about in the air several times. The ceremony is
performed by walking round the sacred pole, and the party return to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s lodging, where his brother-in-law fills the
bride&rsquo;s lap with sweetmeats and water-nut as an omen of
fertility. The <i>maihar</i> or small wedding-cakes of wheat fried in
sesamum oil are distributed to all members of the caste present at the
wedding. While the bridegroom&rsquo;s party is absent at the
bride&rsquo;s house, the women who remain behind enjoy amusements of
their own. One of them strips herself naked, tying up her hair like a
religious mendicant, and is known as B&#257;ba or holy father. In this
state she romps with her companions in turn, while the others laugh and
applaud. Occasionally some man hides himself in a place where he can be
a witness of their play, but if they discover him he is beaten severely
with <i>belnas</i> or wooden bread-rollers. Widow-marriage and divorce
are permitted, the widow being usually expected to marry her late
husband&rsquo;s younger brother, whether he already has a wife or not.
Sexual offences are not severely reprobated, and may be atoned for by a
feast to the caste-fellows.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gadarias worship the ordinary Hindu deities and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>also Dishai Devi, the goddess of the sheep-pen. No
Gadaria may go into the sheep-pen with his shoes on. On entering it in
the morning they make obeisance to the sheep, and these customs seem to
indicate that the goddess Dishai Devi<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1463src" href="#xd21e1463" name="xd21e1463src">2</a> is the
deified sheep. When the sheep are shorn and the fleeces are lying on
the ground they take some milk from one of the ewes and mix rice with
it and sprinkle it over the wool. This rite is called Jimai, and they
say that it is feeding the wool, but it appears to be really a
sacrificial offering to the material. The caste burn the dead when they
can afford to do so, and take the bones to the Ganges or Nerbudda, or
if this is not practicable, throw them into the nearest stream.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Social customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Well-to-do members of the caste employ Br&#257;hmans
for ceremonial purposes, but others dispense with their services. The
Gadarias eat flesh and drink liquor, but abstain from fowls and pork.
They will take food cooked with water from a Lodhi or a D&#257;ngi,
members of these castes having formerly been their feudal chieftains in
the Vindhyan Districts and Nerbudda valley. Br&#257;hmans and members
of the good cultivating castes would be permitted to become Gadarias if
they should so desire. The head of the caste committee has the title of
Mahton and the office is hereditary, the holder being invariably
consulted on caste questions even if he should be a mere boy. The
Gadarias rank with those castes from whom a Br&#257;hman cannot take
water, but above the servile and labouring castes. They are usually
somewhat stupid, lazy and good-tempered, and are quite uneducated.
Owing to their work in cleaning the pens and moving about among the
sheep, the women often carry traces of the peculiar smell of these
animals. This is exemplified in the saying, &lsquo;<i>Ek to Gadaria,
dusre lahsan khae,</i>&rsquo; or &lsquo;Firstly she is a Gadaria and
then she has eaten garlic&rsquo;; the inference being that she is far
indeed from having the scent of the rose.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">6. Goats and sheep.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The regular occupations of the Gadarias are the
breeding and grazing of sheep and goats, and the weaving of country
blankets from sheep&rsquo;s wool. The flocks are usually <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>tended by
the children, while the men and women spin and weave the wool and make
blankets. Goats are bred in larger numbers than sheep in the Central
Provinces, being more commonly used for food and sacrifices, while they
are also valuable for their manure. Any Hindu who thinks an animal
sacrifice requisite, and objects to a fowl as unclean, will choose a
goat; and the animal after being sacrificed provides a feast for the
worshippers, his head being the perquisite of the officiating priest.
Muhammadans and most castes of Hindus will eat goat&rsquo;s meat when
they can afford it. The milk is not popular and there is very little
demand for it locally, but it is often sold to the confectioners, and
occasionally made into butter and exported. Sheep&rsquo;s flesh is also
eaten, but is not so highly esteemed. In the case of both sheep and
goats there is a feeling against consuming the flesh of ewes. Sheep are
generally black in colour and only occasionally white. Goats are black,
white, speckled or reddish-white. Both animals are much smaller than in
Europe. Both sheep and goats are in brisk demand in the cotton tracts
for their manure in the hot-weather months, and will be kept
continually on the move from field to field for a month at a time. It
is usual to hire flocks at the rate of one rupee a hundred head for one
night; but sometimes the cultivators combine to buy a large flock, and
after penning them on their fields in the hot weather, send them to
N&#257;gpur in the beginning of the rains to be disposed of. The
Gadaria was formerly the <i lang="fr">b&ecirc;te noir</i> of the
cultivator, on account of the risk incurred by the crops from the
depredations of his sheep and goats. This is exemplified in the
saying:</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1484">
<p class="line">Ah&#299;r, Gadaria, P&#257;si,</p>
<p class="line">Yeh tinon satyan&#257;si,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">or, &lsquo;The Ah&#299;r (herdsman), the Gadaria and
the P&#257;si, these three are the husbandmen&rsquo;s foes.&rsquo; And
again:</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e1484">
<p class="line">Ah&#299;r, Gadaria, G&#363;jar,</p>
<p class="line">Yeh tinon ch&#257;hen ujar,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">or &lsquo;The Ah&#299;r, the Gadaria and the
G&#363;jar want waste land,&rsquo; that is for grazing their flocks.
But since the demand for manure has arisen, the Gadaria has become a
popular personage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>in the village. The shepherds whistle to their
flocks to guide them, and hang bells round the necks of goats but not
of sheep. Some of them, especially in forest tracts, train ordinary
pariah dogs to act as sheep-dogs. As a rule, rams and he-goats are not
gelt, but those who have large flocks sometimes resort to this practice
and afterwards fatten the animals up for sale. They divide their sheep
into five classes, as follows, according to the length of the ears:
Kan&#257;ri, with ears a hand&rsquo;s length long; Semri, somewhat
shorter; Burhai, ears a forefinger&rsquo;s length; Churia, ears as long
as the little finger; and Neori, with ears as long only as the top
joint of the forefinger. Goats are divided into two classes, those with
ears a hand&rsquo;s length long being called Bangalia or Bagra, while
those with small ears a forefinger&rsquo;s length are known as
Gujra.</p>

<h3 class="main">7. Blanket-weaving.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While ordinary cultivators have now taken to keeping
goats, sheep are still as a rule left to the Gadarias. These are of
course valued principally for their wool, from which the ordinary
country blanket is made. The sheep<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1505src"
href="#xd21e1505" name="xd21e1505src">3</a> are shorn two or sometimes
three times a year, in February, June and September, the best wool
being obtained in February from the cold weather coat. Members of the
caste commonly shear for each other without payment. The wool is carded
with a <i>kamtha</i>, or simple bow with a catgut string, and spun by
the women of the household. Blankets are woven by men on a loom like
that used for cotton cloth. The fabric is coarse and rough, but strong
and durable, and the colour is usually a dark dirty grey, approaching
black, being the same as that of the raw material. Every cultivator has
one of these, and the various uses to which it may be put are admirably
described by &lsquo;Eha&rsquo; as follows: <a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1514src" href="#xd21e1514" name="xd21e1514src">4</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>kammal</i> is a home-spun blanket of the wool of black
sheep, thick, strong, as rough as a farrier&rsquo;s rasp, and of a
colour which cannot get dirty. When the Kunbi (cultivator) comes out of
his hole in the morning it is wrapped round his shoulders and reaches
to his knees, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>guarding him from his great enemy, the cold, for the
thermometer is down to 60&deg; Fahrenheit. By-and-by he has a load to
carry, so he folds his <i>kammal</i> into a thick pad and puts it on
the top of his head. Anon he feels tired, so he lays down his load, and
arranging his <i>kammal</i> as a cushion, sits with comfort on a rugged
rock or a stony bank, and has a smoke. Or else he rolls himself in it
from head to foot, like a mummy, and enjoys a sound sleep on the
roadside. It begins to rain, he folds his <i>kammal</i> into an
ingenious cowl and is safe. Many more are its uses. I cannot number
them all. Whatever he may be called upon to carry, be it forest
produce, or grain or household goods, or his infant child, he will make
a bundle of it with his <i>kammal</i> and poise it on his head, or
sling it across his back, and trudge away.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">8. Sanctity of wool.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Wool is a material of some sanctity among the Hindus.
It is ceremonially pure, and woollen clothing can be worn by
Br&#257;hmans while eating or performing sacred functions. In many
castes the bridegroom at a wedding has a string of wool with a charm
tied round his waist. Religious mendicants wear <i>jatas</i> or wigs of
sheep&rsquo;s wool, and often carry woollen charms. The beads used for
counting prayers are often of wool. The reason for wool being thus held
sacred may be that it was an older kind of clothing used before cotton
was introduced, and thus acquired sanctity by being worn at sacrifices.
Perhaps the Aryans wore woollen clothing when they entered India.</p>

"xd21e1565src" href="#xd21e1565" name="xd21e1565src">1</a>&mdash;A
primitive tribe classified as Mund&#257;ri or Kolarian on linguistic
grounds. The word Gadba, Surgeon-Major Mitchell states, signifies a
person who carries loads on his shoulders. The tribe call themselves
Guthau. They belong to the Vizagapatam District of Madras, and in the
Central Provinces are found only in the Bastar State, into which they
have immigrated to the number of some 700 persons. They speak a
Mund&#257;ri dialect, called Gadba, after their tribal name, and are
one of the two Mund&#257;ri tribes found so far south as Vizagapatam,
the other being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>the Savars.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1573src"
href="#xd21e1573" name="xd21e1573src">2</a> Their tribal organisation
is not very strict, and a Bhatra, a Parja, a Muria, or a member of any
superior caste may become a Gadba at an expenditure of two or three
rupees. The ceremony consists of shaving the body of the novice,
irrespective of sex, clean of hair, after which he or she is given to
eat rice cooked in the water of the Ganges. This is followed by a feast
to the tribe in which a pig must be killed. The Gadbas have totemistic
exogamous septs, usually named after animals, as <i>gut&#257;l</i> dog,
<i>angw&#257;n</i> bear, <i>dungra</i> tortoise, <i>surangai</i> tiger,
<i>g&#363;mal</i> snake, and so on. Members of each sept abstain from
killing or injuring the animal or plant after which it is named, but
they have no scruple in procuring others to do this. Thus if a snake
enters the hut of a person belonging to the G&#363;mal sept, he will
call a neighbour of another sept to kill it. He may not touch its
carcase with his bare hand, but if he holds it through a piece of rag
no sin is incurred.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage is adult, but the rule existing in Madras
that a girl is not permitted to marry until she can weave her own cloth
does not obtain in the Central Provinces.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1599src" href="#xd21e1599" name="xd21e1599src">3</a> As a rule
the parents of the couple arrange the match, but the wishes of the girl
are sometimes consulted and various irregular methods of union are
recognised. Thus a man is permitted with the help of his friends to go
and carry off a girl and keep her as his wife, more especially if she
is a relation on the maternal side more distant than a first cousin.
Another form is the Paisa Mundi, by which a married or unmarried woman
may enter the house of a man of her caste other than her husband and
become his wife; and the Upaliya, when a married woman elopes with a
lover. The marriage ceremony is simple. The bridegroom&rsquo;s party go
to the girl&rsquo;s house, leaving the parents behind, and before they
reach it are met and stopped by a bevy of young girls and men in their
best clothes from the bride&rsquo;s village. A girl comes forward and
demands a ring, which one of the men of the wedding party places on her
finger, and they then proceed to the bride&rsquo;s house, where the
bridegroom&rsquo;s presents, consisting of victuals, liquor, a cloth,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>and two rupees, are opened and carefully examined.
If any deficiency is found, it must at once be made good. The pair eat
a little food together, coloured rice is applied to their foreheads,
and on the second day a new grass shed is erected, in which some rice
is cooked by an unmarried girl. The bride and bridegroom are shut up in
this, and two pots of water are poured over them from the roof, the
marriage being then consummated. If the girl is not adult this ceremony
is omitted. Widow-marriage is permitted by what is called the
<i>t&#299;ka</i> form, by which a few grains of rice coloured with
turmeric are placed on the foreheads of the pair and they are
considered as man and wife. There is no regular divorce, but if a
married woman misbehaves with a man of the caste, the husband goes to
him with a few friends and asks whether the story is true, and if the
accusation is admitted demands a pig and liquor for himself and his
friends as compensation. If these are given he does not turn his wife
out of his house. A <i>liaison</i> of a Gadba woman with a man of a
superior caste is also said to involve no penalty, but if her paramour
is a low-caste man she is excommunicated for ever. In spite of these
lax rules, however, Major Mitchell states that the women are usually
very devoted to their husbands. Mr. Thurston<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1612src" href="#xd21e1612" name="xd21e1612src">4</a> notes that
among the Bonda Gadabas a young man and a maid retire to the jungle and
light a fire. Then the maid, taking a burning stick, places it on the
man&rsquo;s skin. If he cries out he is unworthy of her, and she
remains a maid. If he does not, the marriage is at once consummated.
The application of the brand is probably light or severe according to
the girl&rsquo;s feelings towards the young man.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gadbas worship Burhi M&#257;ta or
Th&#257;kur&#257;ni M&#257;ta, who is the goddess of smallpox and
rinderpest. They offer to her flowers and incense when these diseases
are prevalent among men or cattle, but if the epidemic does not abate
after a time, they abuse the goddess and tell her to do her worst,
suspending the offerings. They offer a white cock to the sun and a red
one to the moon, and various other deities exercise special functions,
Bhand&#257;rin being the goddess of agriculture and Dharni of good
health, while <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>Bharw&#257;n is the protector of cattle and Dand
Dev&#299; of men from the attacks of wild beasts. They have vague
notions of a heaven and hell where the sinful will be punished, and
also believe in re-birth. But these ideas appear to be borrowed from
their Hindu neighbours. When the new rice crop is ripe, the
first-fruits are cooked and served to the cattle in new bamboo baskets,
and are then partaken of by men. The ripening of the mango crop is also
an important festival. In the bright fortnight of Chait (March) the men
go out hunting, and on their return cook the game before M&#257;tideo,
the god of hunting, who lives in a tree. In Madras the whole male
population turn out to hunt, and if they come back without success the
women pelt them with cowdung on their return. If successful, however,
they have their revenge on the women in another way.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1624src" href="#xd21e1624" name="xd21e1624src">5</a> On
festival days men and women dance together to the music of a pipe and
drum. Sometimes they form a circle, holding long poles, and jump
backwards and forwards to and from the centre by means of the pole; or
the women dance singly or in pairs, their hands resting on each
other&rsquo;s waists. A man and woman will then step out of the crowd
and sing at each other, the woman reflecting on the man&rsquo;s
ungainly appearance and want of skill as a cultivator or huntsman,
while the man retorts by reproaching her with her ugliness and
slatternly habits.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1629src" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dead are buried with their feet to the west, ready
to start for the region of the setting sun. On their return from the
funeral the mourners stop on the way, and a fish is boiled and offered
to the dead. An egg is cut in half and placed on the ground, and pieces
of mango bark are laid beside it on which the mourners tread. The women
accompany the corpse, and in the meantime the house of the dead person
is cleaned with cowdung by the children left behind. On the first day
food is supplied to the mourners by their relatives, and in the evening
some cooked rice and vegetables are offered to the dead. The mourning
lasts for nine days, and on the last day a cow or bullock is killed
with the blunt head of an axe, the performance of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>this
function being hereditary in certain families of the caste. Some blood
from the animal and some cooked rice are put in leaf-cups and placed on
the grave by the head of the corpse. The animal is cooked and eaten by
the grave, and they then return to the cooking shed and place its
jawbone under a stick supported on two others, blood and cooked rice
being again offered. The old men and women bathe in warm water, and all
return to the place where the dead man breathed his last. Here they
drink and have another meal of rice and beef, which is repeated on the
following day, and the business of committing the dead to the ancestors
is complete. Liquor is offered to the ancestors on feast days.</p>

<p class="first">The caste are cultivators and labourers, while some
are employed as village watchmen, and others are hereditary
<i>p&#257;lki</i>-bearers to the R&#257;ja of Bastar, enjoying a free
grant of land. They practise shifting cultivation, cleaning a space by
indiscriminate felling in the forest, and roughly ploughing the ground
for a single broad-cast crop of rice; in the following year the
clearing is usually abandoned. Their dress is simple, though they now
wear ordinary cloth. Forty years ago it is said that they wore
coverings made from the bark of the <i>kuring</i> tree and painted with
horizontal bands of red, yellow and blue.<a class="noteref" id=

the thickness of a man&rsquo;s arm made from fine strips of bark is
still worn and is a distinguishing feature of the Gadba women. They
also carry a circlet round their forehead of the seeds of <i>kusa</i>
grass threaded on a string. Both men and women wear enormous earrings,
the men having three in each ear. The Gadbas are almost omnivorous, and
eat flesh, fish, fowls, pork, buffaloes<span class="corr" id=

snakes, large lizards, frogs, sparrows, crows and large red ants. They

Thurston<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1664src" href="#xd21e1664" name=

prejudice:&mdash;&ldquo;The Gadbas of Vizagapatam will not touch a
horse, as they are palanquin-bearers, and have the same objection to a
rival animal as a cart-driver has to a motor-car.&rdquo; They will eat
the leavings of other castes and take food from all except the impure
ones, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=

will not take food or water from a K&#257;yasth. Only the lowest castes
will eat with Gadbas, but they are not considered as impure, and are
allowed to enter temples and take part in religious ceremonies.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>G&#257;nda.</b>&mdash;A servile and impure caste of
Chota N&#257;gpur and the Uriya Districts. They numbered 278,000
persons in 1901, resident largely in Sambalpur and the Uriya States,
but since the transfer of this territory to Bengal, only about 150,000
G&#257;ndas remain in the Central Provinces in Raipur, Bil&#257;spur
and Raigarh. In this Province the G&#257;ndas have become a servile
caste of village drudges, acting as watchmen, weavers of coarse cloth
and musicians. They are looked on as an impure caste, and are
practically in the same position as the Mehras and Cham&#257;rs of
other Districts. In Chota N&#257;gpur, however, they are still in some
places recognised as a primitive tribe,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1681src" href="#xd21e1681" name="xd21e1681src">1</a> being
generally known here as P&#257;n, P&#257;b or Chik. Sir H. Risley
suggests that the name of G&#257;nda may be derived from Gond, and that
the P&#257;ns may originally have been an offshoot of that tribe, but
no connection between the G&#257;ndas and Gonds has been established in
the Central Provinces.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">2. Caste subdivisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The subcastes reported differ entirely from those
recorded in Orissa. In the Central Provinces they are mainly
occupational. Thus the Bajna or Bajgari are those who act as musicians
at feasts and marriages; the M&#257;ng or Mangia make screens and mats,
while their women serve as midwives; the Dholias make baskets; the Doms
skin cattle and the Nag&#257;rchis play on <i>nakk&#257;ras</i> or
drums. Panka is also returned as a subcaste of G&#257;nda, but in the
Central Provinces the Pankas are now practically a separate caste, and
consist of those G&#257;ndas who have adopted Kab&#299;rpanthism and
have thereby obtained some slight rise in status. In Bengal Sir H.
Risley mentions a group called Patradias, or slaves and menials of the
Khonds, and discusses the Patradias as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The group
seems also to include the descendants of P&#257;ns, who sold themselves
as slaves or were sold as Merias or victims to the Khonds. We know that
an extensive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>traffic in children destined for human sacrifice
used to go on in the Khond country, and that the P&#257;ns were the
agents who sometimes purchased, but more frequently kidnapped, the
children, whom they sold to the Khonds, and were so debased that they
occasionally sold their own offspring, though they knew of course the
fate that awaited them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1697src" href=
"#xd21e1697" name="xd21e1697src">2</a> Moreover, apart from the demand
for sacrificial purposes, the practice of selling men as agricultural
labourers was until a few years ago by no means uncommon in the wilder
parts of the Chota N&#257;gpur Division, where labour is scarce and
cash payments are almost unknown. Numbers of formal bonds have come
before me, whereby men sold themselves for a lump sum to enable them to
marry.&rdquo; The above quotation is inserted merely as an interesting
historical reminiscence of the P&#257;ns or G&#257;ndas.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">3. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The G&#257;ndas have exogamous groups or septs of the
usual low-caste type, named after plants, animals or other inanimate
objects. Marriage is prohibited within the sept, and between the
children of two sisters, though the children of brothers and sisters
may marry. If a girl arrives at maturity without a husband having been
found for her, she is wedded to a spear stuck up in the courtyard of
the house, and then given away to anybody who wishes to take her. A
girl going wrong with a man of the caste is married to him by the
ceremony employed in the case of widows, while her parents have to feed
the caste. But a girl seduced by an outsider is permanently expelled.
The betrothal is marked by a present of various articles to the father
of the bride. Marriages must not be celebrated during the three rainy
months of Shr&#257;wan, Bh&#257;don or Kunw&#257;r, nor during the dark
fortnight of the month, nor on a Saturday or Tuesday. The marriage-post
is of the wood of the mahua tree, and beneath it are placed seven
cowries and seven pieces of turmeric. An elderly male member of the
caste known as the Sethia conducts the ceremony, and the couple go five
times round the sacred pole in the morning and thrice in the evening.
When the bride and bridegroom return home after the wedding, an image
of a deer is made with grass and placed behind the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>ear of
the bride. The bridegroom then throws a toy arrow at it made of grass
or thin bamboo, and is allowed seven shots. If he fails to knock it out
of her ear after these the bride&rsquo;s brother takes it and runs away
and the bridegroom must follow and catch him. This is clearly a
symbolic process representing the chase, of the sort practised by the
Khonds and other primitive tribes, and may be taken as a reminiscence
among the G&#257;ndas of their former life in the forests. The
remarriage of widows is permitted, and the younger brother of the
deceased husband takes his widow if he wishes to do so. Otherwise she
may marry whom she pleases. A husband may divorce his wife for adultery
before the caste committee, and if she marries her lover he must repay
to the husband the expenses incurred by the latter on his wedding.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The G&#257;ndas principally worship D&#363;lha Deo,
the young bridegroom who was carried off by a tiger, and they offer a
goat to him at their weddings. They observe the Hindu fasts and
festivals, and at Dasahra worship their musical instruments and the
weaver&rsquo;s loom. Being impure, they do not revere the <i>tulsi</i>
plant nor the banyan or p&#299;pal trees. Children are named on the
sixth day after birth without any special ceremony. The dead are
generally buried from motives of economy, as with most families the
fuel required for cremation would be a serious item of expenditure. A
man is laid on his face in the grave and a woman on her back. Mourning
is observed for three days, except in the case of children under three
years old, whose deaths entail no special observances. On the fourth
day a feast is given, and when all have been served, the chief mourner
takes a little food from the plate of each guest and puts it in a
leaf-cup. He takes another leaf-cup full of water and places the two
outside the house, saying &lsquo;Here is food for you&rsquo; to the
spirit of the departed.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Occupation and social status.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The G&#257;ndas are generally employed either in
weaving coarse cloth or as village musicians. They sing and dance to
the accompaniment of their instruments, the dancers generally being two
young boys dressed as women. They have long hair and put on skirts and
half-sleeved jackets, with hollow anklets round their feet filled with
stones to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>make them tinkle. On their right shoulders are
attached some peacocks&rsquo; feathers, and coloured cloths hang from
their back and arms and wave about when they dance. Among their musical
instruments is the <i>sing-b&#257;ja</i>, a single drum made of iron
with ox-hide leather stretched over it; two horns project from the
sides for purposes of decoration and give the instrument its name, and
it is beaten with thick leather thongs. The <i>dafla</i> is a wooden
drum open on one side and covered with a goat-skin on the other, beaten
with a cane and a bamboo stick. The <i>timki</i> is a single
hemispherical drum of earthenware; and the <i>sahnai</i> is a sort of
bamboo flute. The G&#257;ndas of Sambalpur have strong criminal
tendencies which have recently called for special measures of
repression. Nevertheless they are usually employed as village watchmen
in accordance with long-standing custom. They are considered as impure
and, though not compelled actually to live apart from the village, have
usually a separate quarter and are not permitted to draw water from the
village well or to enter Hindu temples. Their touch defiles, and a
Hindu will not give anything into the hands of one of the caste while
holding it himself, but will throw it down in front of the G&#257;nda,
and will take anything from him in the same manner. They will admit
outsiders of higher rank into the caste, taking from them one or two
feasts. And it is reported that in Raipur a Br&#257;hman recently
entered the caste for love of a G&#257;nda girl.</p>

<b>Th&#257;n&#257;pati.</b>&mdash;The caste of village priests of the
temples of Siva or Mah&#257;deo in Sambalpur and the Uriya States. They
numbered about 700 persons in the Central Provinces in 1911. The caste
appears to be an offshoot of the M&#257;lis or gardeners,
differentiated from them by their special occupation of temple
attendants. In Hindust&#257;n the priests of Siva&rsquo;s temples in
villages are often M&#257;lis, and in the Mar&#257;tha country they are
Guraos, another special caste, or Phulm&#257;lis. Some members of the
caste in Sambalpur, however, aspire to R&#257;jp&#363;t origin and wear
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>the sacred thread. These prefer the designation of
Th&#257;n&#257;pati or &lsquo;Master of the sacred place,&rsquo; and
call the others who do not wear the thread Gandhm&#257;lis.
<i>Gandh</i> means incense. The Th&#257;n&#257;patis say that on one
occasion a R&#257;jp&#363;t prince from Jaipur made a pilgrimage to the
temple of Jagann&#257;th at Puri, and on his return stopped at the
celebrated temple of Mah&#257;deo at Huma near Sambalpur. Mah&#257;deo
appeared before the prince and asked him to become his priest; the
R&#257;jp&#363;t asked to be excused as he was old, but Mah&#257;deo
promised him three sons, which he duly obtained and in gratitude
dedicated them to the service of the god. From these sons the
Th&#257;n&#257;patis say that they are descended, but the claim is no
doubt quite illusory. The truth is, probably, that the
Th&#257;n&#257;patis are priests of the temples situated in towns and
large villages, and owing to their calling have obtained considerable
social estimation, which they desire to justify and place on an
enduring basis by their claim to R&#257;jp&#363;t ancestry; while the
Gandhm&#257;lis are village priests, more or less in the position of
village menials and below the cultivating castes, and any such
pretensions would therefore in their case be quite untenable. There are
signs of the cessation of intermarriage between the two groups, but
this has not been brought about as yet, probably owing to the paucity
of members in the caste and the difficulty of arranging matches. Three
functional subdivisions also appear to be in process of formation, the
Puj&#257;ris or priests of Mah&#257;deo&rsquo;s temples, the
Bandh&#257;dias or those who worship him on the banks of tanks, and the
Mundjhulas<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1752src" href="#xd21e1752" name=
"xd21e1752src">2</a> or devotees of the goddess Somlai in Sambalpur, on
whom the inspiration of the goddess descends, making them shake and
roll their heads. When in this state they are believed to drink the
blood flowing from goats sacrificed in the temple. For the purposes of
marriage the caste is divided into exogamous groups or <i>bargas</i>,
the names of which are usually titles or designations of offices.
Marriage within the <i>barga</i> is prohibited. When the bride is
brought to the altar in the marriage ceremony, she throws a garland of
jasmine flowers on the neck of the bridegroom. This custom resembles
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>the old Swayamw&#257;ra form of marriage, in which
a girl chose her own husband by throwing a garland of flowers round his
neck. But it probably has no connection with this and merely denotes
the fact that the caste are gardeners by profession, similar ceremonies
typifying the caste calling being commonly performed at marriages,
especially among the Telugu castes. Girls should be married before
adolescence and, as is usual among the Uriya castes, if no suitable
husband is forthcoming a symbolic marriage is celebrated; the
Th&#257;n&#257;patis make her go through the form with her maternal
grandfather or sister&rsquo;s husband, and in default of them with a
tree. She is then immediately divorced and disposed of as a widow.
Divorce and the remarriage of widows are permitted. A bachelor marrying
a widow must first go through the ceremony with a flower. The
Gandhm&#257;lis, as the priests of Mah&#257;deo, are generally Saivas
and wear red clothes covered with ochre. They consider that their
ultimate ancestor is the N&#257;g or cobra and especially observe the
festival of N&#257;g-Panchmi, abstaining from any cooked food on that
day. They both burn and bury the dead and perform the
<i>shr&#257;ddh</i> ceremony or the offering of sacrificial cakes. They
eat flesh but do not drink liquor. Their social position is fairly good
and Br&#257;hmans will take water from their hands. Many of them hold
free grants of land in return for their services at the temples. A few
are ordinary cultivators.</p>

"xd21e1778src" href="#xd21e1778" name="xd21e1778src">1</a>&mdash;A
caste of village menials whose function it is to avert hailstorms from
the crops. They are found principally in the Mar&#257;tha Districts of
the N&#257;gpur country and Ber&#257;r, and numbered 9000 persons in
1911. The name is derived from the Mar&#257;thi <i>g&#257;r</i>, hail.
The G&#257;rpag&#257;ris are really N&#257;ths or Jogis who have taken
to this calling and become a separate caste. They wear clothes coloured
with red ochre, and a garland of <i>rudr&#257;ksha</i> beads, and bury
their dead in a sitting posture. According to their tradition the first
G&#257;rpag&#257;ri was one R&#257;ut, a Jogi, who accompanied a Kunbi
m&#257;lguz&#257;r on a visit to Ben&#257;res, and while there he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>prophesied that on a certain day all the crops of
their village would be destroyed by a hailstorm. The Kunbi then
besought him to save the crops if he could, and he answered that by his
magic he could draw off the hail from the rest of the village and
concentrate it in his own field, and he agreed to do this if the
cultivators would recompense him for his loss. When the two came home
to their village they found that there had been a severe hailstorm, but
it had all fallen in the Jogi&rsquo;s field. His loss was made good to
him and he adopted this calling as a profession, becoming the first
G&#257;rpag&#257;ri, and being paid by contributions from the
proprietor and tenants. There are no subcastes except that the Kharchi
G&#257;rpag&#257;ri are a bastard group, with whom the others refuse to
intermarry.</p>

<p class="first">Marriage is regulated by exogamous groups, two of
which, Wat&#257;ri from the Ot&#257;ri or brass-worker, and Dhankar
from the Dhangar or shepherds, are named after other castes. Some are
derived from the names of animals, as Harnya from the black-buck, and
W&#257;gh from the tiger. The Diunde group take their name from
<i>diundi</i>, the kotwar&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1797src"
href="#xd21e1797" name="xd21e1797src">2</a> drum. They say that their
ancestor was so named because he killed his brother, and was proclaimed
as an outlaw by beat of drum. The marriage of members of the same group
is forbidden and also that of the children of two sisters, so long as
the relationship between them is remembered. The caste usually
celebrate their weddings after those of the Kunbis, on whom they depend
for contributions to their expenses. Widow-marriage is permitted, but
the widow sometimes refuses to marry again, and, becoming a Bhagat or
devotee, performs long pilgrimages in male attire. Divorce is
permitted, but as women are scarce, is rarely resorted to. The
G&#257;rpag&#257;ris say, &ldquo;If one would not throw away a
vegetable worth a <i>damri</i> (one-eighth of a pice or farthing), how
shall one throw away a wife who is 3&frac12; cubits long.&rdquo; A
divorced wife is allowed to marry again.</p>

<p class="first">The caste worship Mah&#257;deo or Siva and
Mah&#257;b&#299;r or Hanum&#257;n, and do not usually distinguish them.
Their principal festival is called M&#257;hi and takes place on the
first day of Poush (December), this being the day from which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>hailstorms may be expected to occur; and next to
this M&#257;ndo Am&#257;was, or the first day of Chait (March), after
which hailstorms need not be feared. They offer goats to Mah&#257;deo
in his terrible form of K&#257;l Bhairava, and during the ceremony the
Kunbis beat the <i>d&#257;heka</i>, a small drum with bells, to enhance
the effect of the sacrifice, so that their crops may be saved. When a
man is at the point of death he is placed in the sitting posture in
which he is to be buried, for fear that after death his limbs may
become so stiff that they cannot be made to assume it. The corpse is
carried to the grave in a cloth coloured with red ochre. A gourd
containing pulse and rice, a pice coin, and a small quantity of any
drug to which the deceased may have been addicted in life are placed in
the hands, and the grave is filled in with earth and salt. A lamp is
lighted on the place where the death occurred, for one night, and on
the third day a cocoanut is broken there, after which mourning ends and
the house is cleaned. A stone brought from the bed of a river is
plastered down on to the grave with clay, and this may perhaps
represent the dead man&rsquo;s spirit.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Occupation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The occupation of the G&#257;rpag&#257;ri is to avert
hailstorms, and he was formerly remunerated by a customary contribution
of rice from each cultivator in the village. He received the usual
presents at seed-time and harvest, and two pice from each tenant on the
Basant-Panchmi festival. When the sky is of mixed red and black at
night like smoke and flame, the G&#257;rpag&#257;ri knows that a
hailstorm is coming. Then, taking a sword in his hand, he goes and
stands before Mah&#257;b&#299;r, and begs him to disperse the clouds.
When entreaties fail, he proceeds to threats, saying that he will kill
himself, and throws off his clothes. Sometimes his wife and children go
and stand with him before Mah&#257;b&#299;r&rsquo;s shrine and he
threatens to kill them. Formerly he would cut and slash himself, so it
is said, if Mah&#257;b&#299;r was obdurate, but now the utmost he does
is to draw some blood from a finger. He would also threaten to
sacrifice his son, and instances are known of his actually having done
so.</p>
<p>Two ideas appear to be involved in these sacrifices of the
G&#257;rpag&#257;ri. One is the familiar principle of atonement, the
blood being offered to appease the god as a substitute <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>for the
crops which he seems about to destroy. But when the G&#257;rpag&#257;ri
threatened to kill himself, and actually killed his son, it was not
merely as an atonement, because in that case the threats would have had
no meaning. His intention seems rather to have been to lay the guilt of
homicide upon the god by slaying somebody in front of his shrine, in
case nothing less would move him from his purpose of destroying the
crops. The idea is the same as that with which people committed suicide
in order that their ghosts might haunt those who had driven them to the
act. As late as about the year 1905 a Gond Bhumka or village priest was
hanged in Chhindw&#257;ra for killing his two children. He owed a debt
of Rs. 25 and the creditor was pressing him and he had nothing to pay.
So he flew into a rage and exclaimed that the gods would do nothing for
him even though he was a Bhumka, and he seized his two children and cut
off their heads and laid them before the god. In this it would appear
that the Bhumka&rsquo;s intention was partly to take revenge on his
master for the neglect shown to him, the god&rsquo;s special servant.
The G&#257;rpag&#257;ri diverts the hail by throwing a handful of grain
in the direction in which he wishes it to go. When the storm begins he
will pick up some hailstones, smear them with his blood and throw them
away, telling them to rain over rivers, hills, forests and barren
ground. When caterpillars or locusts attack the crops he catches one or
two and offers them at Mah&#257;b&#299;r&rsquo;s shrine, afterwards
throwing them up in the air. Or he buries one alive and this is
supposed to stay the plague. When rust appears in the crops, one or two
blades are in like manner offered to Mah&#257;b&#299;r, and it is
believed that the disease will be stayed. Or if the rice plants do not
come into ear a few of them are plucked and offered, and fresh fertile
blades then come up. He also has various incantations which are
believed to divert the storm or to cause the hailstones to melt into
water. In some localities, when the buffalo is slaughtered at the
Dasahra festival, the G&#257;rpag&#257;ri takes seven different kinds
of spring-crop seeds and dips them in its blood. He buries them in a
spot beside his hearth, and it is believed that when a hailstorm
threatens the grains move about and give out a humming sound like water
boiling. Thus the G&#257;rpag&#257;ri has <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>warning of the storm. If
the G&#257;rpag&#257;ri is absent and a storm comes his wife will go
and stand naked before Mah&#257;b&#299;r&rsquo;s shrine. The wives know
the incantations, but they must not learn them from their husbands,
because in that case the husband would be in the position of a
<i>guru</i> or spiritual preceptor to his wife and the conjugal
relation could no longer continue. No other caste will learn the
incantations, for to make the hailstones melt is regarded as equivalent
to causing an abortion, and as a sin for which heavy retribution would
be incurred in a future life.</p>
<p>In Chhatt&#299;sgarh the Baiga or village priest of the aboriginal
tribes averts hailstorms in the same manner as the G&#257;rpag&#257;ri,
and elsewhere the Barais or betel-vine growers perform this function,
which is especially important to them because their vines are so liable
to be injured by hailstorms. In ancient Greece there existed a village
functionary, the <i>Chalazo phulax</i>, who kept off hailstorms in
exactly the same manner as the G&#257;rpag&#257;ri. He would offer a
victim, and if he had none would draw blood from his own fingers to
appease the storm.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1832src" href=
"#xd21e1832" name="xd21e1832src">3</a></p>
<p>The same power has even been imputed to Christian priests as
recorded by Sir James Frazer: &ldquo;In many villages of Provence the
priest is still required to possess the faculty of averting storms. It
is not every priest who enjoys this reputation; and in some villages
when a change of pastors takes place, the parishioners are eager to
learn whether the new incumbent has the power (<i>pouder</i>) as they
call it. At the first sign of a heavy storm they put him to the proof
by inviting him to exorcise the threatening clouds; and if the result
answers to their hopes, the new shepherd is assured of the sympathy and
respect of his flock. In some parishes where the reputation of the
curate in this respect stood higher than that of the rector, the
relations between the two have been so strained in consequence that the
bishop has had to translate the rector to another
benefice.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1843src" href="#xd21e1843"
name="xd21e1843src">4</a></p>
<p>Of late years an unavoidable scepticism as to the
G&#257;rpag&#257;ri&rsquo;s efficiency has led to a reduction of his
earnings, and the cultivators now frequently decline to give him
anything, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>only a sheaf of corn at harvest. Some members of
the caste have taken to weaving <i>new&#257;r</i> or broad tape for
beds, and others have become cultivators.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Gauria.</b><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1869src"
href="#xd21e1869" name="xd21e1869src">1</a>&mdash;A small caste of
snake-charmers and jugglers who are an offshoot of the Gond tribe. They
number about 500 persons and are found only in Chhatt&#299;sgarh. They
have the same exogamous septs as the Gonds, as Mark&#257;m, Marai,
Net&#257;m, Chhedaiha, Jagat, Purteti, Chichura and others. But they
are no doubt of very mixed origin, as is shown by the fact that they do
not eat together at their feasts, but the guests all cook their own
food and eat it separately. And after a daughter has been married her
own family even will not take food from her hand because they are
doubtful of her husband&rsquo;s status. It is said that the Gaurias
were accustomed formerly to beg only from the Kewat caste, though this
restriction is no longer maintained. The fact may indicate that they
are partly descended from the unions of Kewats with Gond women.</p>
<p>Adult marriage is the general rule of the caste and a fixed
bride-price of sixteen rupees is paid. The couple go away together at
once and six months afterwards return to visit the bride&rsquo;s
parents, when they are treated as outsiders and not allowed to touch
the food cooked for the family, while they reciprocally insist on
preparing their own. Male Gaurias will take food from any of the higher
castes, but the women will eat only from Gaurias. They will admit
outsiders belonging to any caste from whom they can take food into the
community. And if a Gauria woman goes wrong with a member of any of
these castes they overlook the matter and inflict only a feast as a
penalty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>Their marriage ceremony consists merely in the placing of bangles on
the woman&rsquo;s wrists, which is the form by which a widow is married
among other castes. If a widow marries a man other than her
husband&rsquo;s younger brother, the new husband must pay twelve rupees
to her first husband&rsquo;s family, or to her parents if she has
returned to them. If she takes with her a child born of her first
husband with permission to keep it, the second husband must pay eight
rupees to the first husband&rsquo;s family as the price of the child.
But if the child is to be returned as soon as it is able to shift for
itself the second husband receives eight rupees instead of paying it,
as remuneration for his trouble in rearing the baby. The caste bury
their dead with the feet to the south, like the Hindus. The principal
business of the Gaurias is to catch and exhibit snakes, and they carry
a <i>damru</i> or rattle in the shape of an hour-glass, which is
considered to be a distinctive badge of the caste. If a Gauria saw an
Ojha snake-charmer carrying a <i>damru</i> he would consider himself
entitled to take it from the Ojha forcibly if he could. A Gauria is
forbidden to exhibit monkeys under penalty of being put out of caste.
Their principal festival is the N&#257;g-Panchmi, when the cobra is
worshipped. They also profess to know charms for curing persons bitten
by snakes. The following incantation is cried by a Gauria snake-doctor
three times into the ears of his patient in a loud voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>bel</i> tree and the <i>bel</i> leaves are on the
other side of the river. All the Gaurias are drowned in it. The breast
of the <i>koil</i>; over it is a net. Eight snakes went to the forest.
They tamed rats on the green tree. The snakes are flying, causing the
parrots to fly. They want to play, but who can make them play? After
finishing their play they stood up; arise thou also, thou sword. I am
waking you (the patient) up by crying in your ear, I conjure you by the
name of Dhanvantari<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1894src" href=
"#xd21e1894" name="xd21e1894src">2</a> to rise carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Similar meaningless charms are employed for curing the bites of
scorpions and for exorcising bad spirits and the influence of the evil
eye.</p>
<p>The Gaurias will eat almost all kinds of flesh, including pigs,
rats, fowls and jackals, but they abstain from beef. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>Their
social status is so low that practically no caste will take food or
water from them, but they are not considered as impure. They are great
drunkards, and are easily known by their <i>damrus</i> or rattles and
the baskets in which they carry their snakes. <span class=

"xd21e1961src" href="#xd21e1961" name="xd21e1961src">1</a>&mdash;A low
Dravidian caste of Orissa and Central India who cut grass, tend horses
and act as village musicians at festivals. In the Central Provinces
they numbered 43,000 in 1911, residing principally in the
Chhatt&#299;sgarh Division and the adjoining Feudatory States. The word
Ghasia is derived from <i>gh&#257;s</i> (grass) and means a
grass-cutter. Sir H. Risley states that they are a fishing and
cultivating caste of Chota N&#257;gpur and Central India, who attend as
musicians at weddings and festivals and also perform menial offices of
all kinds.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1967src" href="#xd21e1967" name=

Pur&#257;nas, though descended from the union of a Br&#257;hmini and a
S&#363;dra, are the lowest of the low, the Ghasias are Chand&#257;ls

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ghasias generally, however, appear now to be a
harmless caste of labourers without any specially degrading or
repulsive traits. In Mandla their social position and customs are much
on a par with those of the Gonds, from whom a considerable section of
the caste seems to be derived. In other localities they have probably
immigrated into the Central Provinces from Bundelkhand and Orissa.
Among their subdivisions the following may be mentioned: the Udia, who
cure raw hides and do the work of sweepers and are generally looked
down on; the Dingkuchia, who castrate cattle and ponies; the Dolboha,
who carry <i>dhoolies</i> or palanquins; the Nag&#257;rchi, who derive
their name from the <i>nakk&#257;ra</i> or kettle-drum and are village
musicians; the Khaltaha or those from Raipur; the Laria, belonging to
Chhatt&#299;sgarh, and the Uria of the Uriya country; the
R&#257;mgarhia, who take their name from R&#257;mgarh in the Mandla
District, and the Mahobia from Mahoba in Bundelkhand. Those members of
the caste who work as grooms have become a separate group and call
themselves Sais, dropping the name of Ghasia. They rank higher than the
others and marry among themselves, and some of them have become
cultivators or work as village watchmen. They are also called
Th&#257;nwar by the Gonds, the word meaning stable or stall. In Chota
N&#257;gpur a number of Ghasias have become tailors and are tending to
form a separate subcaste under the name of Darzi.</p>

<p class="first">Their septs are of the usual low-caste type, being
named after animals, inanimate objects or nicknames of ancestors. One
of them is P&#257;nch-biha or &lsquo;He who had five wives,&rsquo; and
another Kul-d&#299;p or &lsquo;The sept of the lamp.&rsquo; Members of
this sept will stop eating if a lamp goes out. The Janta Ragda take
their name from the mill for grinding corn and will not have a
grinding-mill in their houses. They say that a female ancestor was
delivered of a child when sitting near a grinding-mill and this gave
the sept its name. Three septs are named after other castes:
Kumh&#257;rbans, descended from a potter; G&#257;ndbans, from a
G&#257;nda; and Luha, from a Loh&#257;r or blacksmith, and which names
indicate that members of these castes have been admitted into the
community.</p>

permitted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=

Those members of the caste who have become Kab&#299;rpanthis may also
marry with the others. Marriages may be infant or adult. A girl who is
seduced by a member of the caste is married to him by a simple
ceremony, the couple standing before a twig of the
<i>&#363;mar</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2010src" href="#xd21e2010"
name="xd21e2010src">5</a> tree, while some women sprinkle turmeric over
them. If a girl goes wrong with an outsider she is permanently expelled
and a feast is exacted from her parents. The boy and his relatives go
to the girl&rsquo;s house for the betrothal, and a present of various
articles of food and dress is made to her family, apparently as a sort
of repayment for their expenditure in feeding and clothing her. A gift
of clothes is also made to her mother, called <i>dudh-s&#257;ri</i>,
and is regarded as the price of the milk with which the mother
nourished the girl in her infancy. A goat, which forms part of the
bride-price, is killed and eaten by the parties and their relatives.
The binding portion of the marriage is the <i>bh&#257;nwar</i>
ceremony, at which the couple walk seven times round the marriage-post,
holding each other by the little fingers. When they return to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house, a cock or a goat is killed and the head
buried before the door; the foreheads of the couple are marked with its
blood and they go inside the house. If the bride is not adult, she goes
home after a stay of two days, and the <i>gauna</i> or going-away
ceremony is performed when she finally leaves her parents&rsquo; house.
The remarriage of widows is permitted, no restriction being imposed on
the widow in her choice of a second husband. Divorce is permitted for
infidelity on the part of the wife.</p>

<p class="first">Children are named on the sixth day after birth,
special names being given to avert ill-luck, while they sometimes go
through the ceremony of selling a baby for five cowries in order to
disarm the jealousy of the godlings who are hostile to children. They
will not call any person by name when they think an owl is within
hearing, as they believe that the owl will go on repeating the name and
that this will cause the death of the person bearing it. The caste
generally revere D&#363;lha Deo, the bridegroom god, whose altar stands
near the cooking place, and the goddess Devi. <span class=

three years they offer a white goat to Bura Deo, the great god of the
Gonds. They worship the sickle, the implement of their trade, at
Dasahra, and offer cocoanuts and liquor to Gh&#257;si S&#257;dhak, a
godling who lives by the peg to which horses are tied in the stable. He
is supposed to protect the horse from all kinds of diseases. At Dasahra
they also worship the horse. Their principal festival is called Karma
and falls on the eleventh day of the second half of Bh&#257;don
(August). On this day they bring a branch of a tree from the forest and
worship it with betel, areca-nut and other offerings. All through the
day and night the men and women drink and dance together. They both
burn and bury the dead, throwing the ashes into water. For the first
three days after a death they set out rice and pulse and water in a
leaf cup for the departed spirit. They believe that the ghosts of the
dead haunt the living, and to cure a person possessed in this manner
they beat him with shoes and then bury an effigy of the ghost outside
the village.</p>

<p class="first">The Ghasias usually work as grass-cutters and grooms
to horses, and some of them make loom-combs for weavers. These last are
looked down upon and called Madarchawa. They make the <i>k&#363;nch</i>
or brushes for the loom, like the K&#363;chbandhias, from the root of
the <i>babai</i> or khas-khas grass, and the <i>r&#257;chh</i> or comb
for arranging the threads on the loom from the stalks of the
<i>bharru</i> grass. Other Ghasias make ordinary hair combs from the
<i>kathai</i>, a grass which grows densely on the borders of streams
and springs. The frame of the comb is of bamboo and the teeth are fixed
in either by thread or wire, the price being one pice (farthing) in the
former case and two in the latter.</p>

<p class="first">The caste admit outsiders by a disgusting ceremony in
which the candidate is shaved with urine and forced to eat a mixture of
cowdung, basil leaves, <i>dub</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2057src"
href="#xd21e2057" name="xd21e2057src">6</a> grass and water in which a
piece of silver or gold has been dipped. The women do not wear the
<i>choli</i> or breast-cloth nor the nose-ring, and in some localities
they do not have spangles on the forehead. Women are tattooed on
various parts of the body before marriage with the idea of enhancing
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>beauty, and sometimes tattooing is resorted to for
curing a pain in some joint or for rheumatism. A man who is temporarily
put out of caste is shaved on readmission, and in the case of a woman a
lock of her hair is cut. To touch a dead cow is one of the offences
entailing temporary excommunication. They employ a Br&#257;hman only to
fix the dates of their marriages. The position of the caste is very low
and in some places they are considered as impure. The Ghasias are very
poor, and a saying about them is &lsquo;<i>Ghasia ki jindagi
hasia</i>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;The Ghasia is supported by his
sickle,&rsquo; the implement used for cutting grass. The Ghasias are
perhaps the only caste in the Central Provinces outside those commonly
returning themselves as Mehtar, who consent to do scavenger&rsquo;s
work in some localities.</p>

<h3 class="main">8. Ghasias and K&#257;yasths.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste have a peculiar aversion to K&#257;yasths
and will not take food or water from them nor touch a
K&#257;yasth&rsquo;s bedding or clothing. They say that they would not
serve a K&#257;yasth as horse-keeper, but if by any chance one of them
was reduced to doing so, he at any rate would not hold his
master&rsquo;s stirrup for him to mount. To account for this hereditary
enmity they tell the following story:</p>
<p>On one occasion the son of the K&#257;yasth minister of the
R&#257;ja of Ratanpur went out for a ride followed by a Ghasia sais
(groom). The boy was wearing costly ornaments, and the Ghasia&rsquo;s
cupidity being excited, he attacked and murdered the child, stripped
him of his ornaments and threw the body down a well. The murder was
discovered and in revenge the minister killed every Ghasia, man, woman
or child that he could lay his hands on. The only ones who escaped were
two pregnant women who took refuge in the hut of a G&#257;nda and were
sheltered by him. To them were born a boy and a girl and the present
Ghasias are descended from the pair. Therefore a Ghasia will eat even
the leavings of a G&#257;nda but will accept nothing from the hands of
a K&#257;yasth.</p>
<p>This story is an instance of the process which has been called the
transplantation of myth. Sir H. Risley tells a similar legend of the
Ghasias of Orissa,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2078src" href=
"#xd21e2078" name="xd21e2078src">7</a> but in their case it was a young
K&#257;yasth bridegroom who was killed, and before dying he got leave
from his murderers to write a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href=
"#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>letter to his relatives informing
them of his death, on condition that he said nothing as to its manner.
But in the letter he disclosed the murder, and the Ghasias, who could
not read, were duly brought to justice. In the Ratanpur story as
reported from Bil&#257;spur it was stated that &ldquo;Somehow, even
from down the well, the minister&rsquo;s son managed to get a letter
sent to his father telling him of the murder.&rdquo; And this sentence
seems sufficient to establish the fact that the Central Provinces story
has merely been imported from Orissa and slightly altered to give it
local colour. The real reason for the traditional aversion felt by the
Ghasias and other low castes for the K&#257;yasths will be discussed in
the article on that caste.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Ghosi.</b><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2092src"
href="#xd21e2092" name="xd21e2092src">1</a>&mdash;A caste of herdsmen
belonging to northern India and found in the Central Provinces in
Saugor and other Districts of the Jubbulpore and Nerbudda Divisions. In
1911 they numbered 10,000 persons in this Province out of a strength of
about 60,000 in India. The name is said to be derived from the Sanskrit
root <i>ghush</i>, to shout, the word <i>ghosha</i> meaning one who
shouts as he herds his cattle. A noticeable fact about the caste is
that, while in Upper India they are all Muhammadans&mdash;and it is
considered to be partly on account of the difference in religion that
they have become differentiated into a separate caste from the
Ah&#299;rs&mdash;in the Central Provinces they are nearly all Hindus
and show no trace of Muhammadan practices. A few Muhammadan Ghosis are
found in Nim&#257;r and some Muhammadans who call themselves Gaddi in
Mandla are believed to be Ghosis. And as the Ghosis of the northern
Districts of the Central Provinces must in common with the bulk of the
population be descended from immigrants from northern India, it would
appear that they must have changed their religion, or rather abandoned
one to which their ancestors had only been imperfectly proselytised,
when it was no longer the dominant faith of the locality in which they
lived. Sir D. Ibbetson says that in the Punjab the name Ghosi is used
only for Muhammadans, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href=
"#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>is often applied to any cowherd or
milkman of that religion, whether G&#363;jar, Ah&#299;r or of any other
caste, just as Go&#257;la is used for a Hindu cowherd. It is said that
Hindus will buy pure milk from the Musalm&#257;n Ghosi, but will reject
it if there is any suspicion of its having been watered by the latter,
as they must not drink water at his hands.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2103src" href="#xd21e2103" name="xd21e2103src">2</a> But in
Ber&#257;r Br&#257;hmans will now buy milk and curds from Muhammadan
milkmen. Mr. Crooke remarks that most of the Ghosis are Ah&#299;rs who
have been converted to Isl&#257;m. To the east of the United Provinces
they claim a G&#363;jar origin, and here they will not eat beef
themselves nor take food with any Muhammadans who consume it. They
employ Br&#257;hmans to fix the auspicious times for marriage and other
ceremonies. The Ghosis of Lucknow have no other employment but the
keeping of milch cattle, chiefly buffaloes of all kinds, and they breed
buffaloes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2109src" href="#xd21e2109" name=
"xd21e2109src">3</a> This is the case also in Saugor, where the Ghosis
are said to rank below ordinary Ah&#299;rs because they breed and tend
buffaloes instead of cows. Those of Narsinghpur, however, are generally
not herdsmen at all but ordinary cultivators. In northern India, owing
to the large number of Muhammadans who, other things being equal, would
prefer to buy their milk and <i>gh&#299;</i> from co-religionists,
there would be an opening for milkmen professing this faith, and on the
facts stated above it may perhaps be surmised that the Ghosi caste came
into existence to fill the position. Or they may have been forcibly
converted as a number of Ah&#299;rs in Ber&#257;r were forcibly
converted to <span class="corr" id="xd21e2118" title=
"Source: Islam">Isl&#257;m</span>, and still call themselves
Muhammadans, though they can scarcely repeat the Kalma and only go to
mosque once a year.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2121src" href=
"#xd21e2121" name="xd21e2121src">4</a> But when some of the Ghosis
migrated into the Central Provinces, they would find, in the absence of
a Musalm&#257;n clientele, that their religion, instead of being an
advantage, was a positive drawback to them, as Hindus would be
reluctant to buy milk from a Muhammadan who might be suspected of
having mixed it with water; and it would appear that they have relapsed
naturally into Hinduism, all traces of their profession of Isl&#257;m
being lost. Even so, however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href=
"#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>in Narsinghpur they have had to
abandon their old calling and become ordinary cultivators, while in
Saugor, perhaps on account of their doubtful status, they are
restricted to keeping buffaloes. If this suggestion turned out to be
well founded, it would be an interesting instance of a religion being
changed to secure a professional advantage. But it can only be
considered as a guess. A parallel to the disadvantage of being unable
to water their milk without rendering it impure, which attaches to the
Ghosis of the Punj&#257;b, may be adduced in the case of the Telis of
the small town of Multai in Bet&#363;l District. Here the
dairyman&rsquo;s business is for some reason in the hands of Telis
(oilmen) and it is stated that from every Teli who engages in it a
solemn oath is exacted that he will not put water in the milk, and any
violation of this would be punished by expulsion from caste. Because if
the Hindus once found that they had been rendered impure by drinking
water touched by so low a caste as the Telis, they would decline any
longer to purchase milk from them. It is curious that the strict rule
of ceremonial purity which obtains in the case of water has apparently
no application to milk.</p>
<p>In the Central Provinces the Ghosis have two subcastes, the Havelia
or those living in open wheat country, and the Birchheya or residents
of jungle tracts. In Saugor they have another set of divisions borrowed
from the Ah&#299;rs, and here the Muhammadan Ghosis are said to be a
separate subcaste, though practically none were returned at the census.
They have the usual system of exogamous groups with territorial names
derived from those of villages. At their marriages the couple walk six
times round the sacred post, reserving the seventh round, if the bride
is a child, to be performed subsequently when she goes to her husband.
But if she is adult, the full number may be completed, the ceremony
known as <i>lot pata</i> coming between the sixth and seventh rounds.
In this the bride sits first on the right of her husband and then
changes seats so as to be on his left; and she is thus considered to
become joined to her husband as the left part of his body, which the
Hindus consider the wife to be, holding the same belief as that
expressed in Genesis. After this the bride takes some child of the
household into her lap <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35"
name="pb35">35</a>]</span>and then makes it over to the bridegroom
saying, &lsquo;Take care of the baby while I go and do the household
work.&rsquo; This ceremony, which has been recorded also of the
K&#257;pus in Ch&#257;nda, is obviously designed as an auspicious omen
that the marriage may be blessed with children. Like other castes of
their standing, the Ghosis permit polygamy, divorce and the remarriage
of widows, but the practice of taking two wives is rare. The dead are
burnt, with the exception that the bodies of young children whose ears
have not been pierced and of persons dying of smallpox are buried.
Children usually have their ears pierced when they are three or four
years old. A corpse must not be taken to the pyre at night, as it is
thought that in that case it would be born blind in the next birth. The
caste have bards and genealogists of their own who are known as Patia.
In Damoh the Ghosis are mainly cart-drivers and cultivators and very
few of them sell milk. In Nim&#257;r there are some Muhammadan Ghosis
who deal in milk. Their women are not secluded and may be known by the
number of little rings worn in the ear after the Muhammadan custom.
Like the Ah&#299;rs, the Ghosis are considered to be somewhat stupid.
They call themselves Ghosi Th&#257;kur, as they claim to be
R&#257;jp&#363;ts, and outsiders also sometimes address them as
Th&#257;kur. But in Sangor and Damoh these aspirations to Kshatriya
rank are so widespread that when one person asks another his caste the
usual form of the question is &lsquo;What Th&#257;kur are you?&rsquo;
The questioner thus politely assumes that his companion must be a
R&#257;jp&#363;t of some sort and leaves it to him to admit or deny the
soft impeachment. Another form of this question is to say &lsquo;What
<i>dudh</i>, or milk, are you?&rsquo;</p>

<b>Golla</b>, <b>Gola</b>, <b>Golkar</b>.&mdash;The great shepherd
caste of the Telugu country, which numbers nearly 1&frac12; million of
persons in Madras and Hyder&#257;b&#257;d. In the Central Provinces
there were under 3000 Golars in 1901, and they were returned
principally from the B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t and Seoni Districts. But
2500 Golkars, who belonged to Ch&#257;nda and were classified under
Ah&#299;rs in 1901, may, in view of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>information now
available, be considered to belong to the Golar caste. Some 2000 Golars
were enumerated in Ber&#257;r. They are a nomadic people and frequent
B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t, owing to the large area of grazing land found
in the District. The caste come from the south and speak a dialect of
Canarese. Hindus liken the conversation of two Golars to two cocks
crowing at each other.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2161src" href=
"#xd21e2161" name="xd21e2161src">2</a> They seem to have no subcastes
except that in Ch&#257;nda the Yera and N&#257;na, or black and white
Golkars, are distinguished. Marriage is regulated by the ordinary
system of exogamous groups, but no meaning can be assigned to the names
of these. In Seoni they say that their group-names are the same as
those of the Gonds, and that they are related to this great tribe; but
though both are no doubt of the same Dravidian stock, there is no
reason for supposing any closer affinity to exist, and the statement
may be explained by the fact that Golars frequently reside in Gond
villages in the forest; and in accordance with a practice commonly
found among village communities the fiction of relationship has grown
up. The children of brothers and sisters are allowed to marry, but not
those of two sisters, the reason stated for this prohibition being that
during the absence of the mother her sister nurses her children; the
children of sisters are therefore often foster brothers and sisters,
and this is considered as equivalent to the real relationship. But the
marriage of a brother&rsquo;s son to a sister&rsquo;s daughter is held,
as among the Gonds, to be a most suitable union. The adult marriage of
girls involves no stigma, and the practice of serving for a wife is
sometimes followed. Weddings may not be held during the months of
Shr&#257;wan, Bh&#257;don, Kunw&#257;r and P&#363;s. The marriage altar
is made of dried cowdung plastered over with mud, in honour perhaps of
the animal which affords the Golars their livelihood. The clothes of
the bridegroom and bride are knotted together and they walk five times
round the altar. In Bhand&#257;ra the marriages of Golars are
celebrated both at the bride&rsquo;s house and the bridegroom&rsquo;s.
The bridegroom rides on a horse, and on arrival at the marriage-shed is
presented by his future mother-in-law with a cup of milk. The bride and
bridegroom sit on a platform together, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>each
gets up and sits down nine times, whoever accomplishes this first being
considered to have won. The bridegroom then takes the bride&rsquo;s
little finger in his hand and they walk nine times round the platform.
He afterwards falls at the girl&rsquo;s feet, and standing up carries
her inside the house, where they eat together out of one dish. After
three days the party proceeds to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, where
the same ceremonies are gone through. Here the family barbers of the
bride and bridegroom take the couple up in their arms and dance,
holding them, and all the party dance too. The remarriage of widows is
permitted, a sum of Rs. 25 being usually paid to the parents of the
woman by her second husband. Divorce may be effected at the option of
either party, and documents are usually drawn up on both sides. The
Golars worship Mah&#257;deo and have a special deity, Hularia, who
protects their cattle from disease and wild beasts. A clay image of
Hularia is erected outside the village every five or ten years and
goats are offered to it. Each head of a family is supposed to offer on
the first occasion two goats, and on the second and subsequent ones,
five, seven, nine and twelve goats respectively. But when a man dies
his son starts afresh with an offering of two. The flesh of the animals
offered is consumed by the caste-fellows. The name Hularia Deo has some
connection with the Holias, a low Telugu caste of leather-workers to
whom the Golars appear to be related, as they have the same family
names. When a Golar dies a plate of cooked rice is laid on his body and
then carried to the burning-<i>gh&#257;t</i>. The Holias belonging to
the same section go with it, and before arrival the plate of rice is
laid on the ground and the Holias eat it. The Golars have various
superstitions, and on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays they will not give
salt, fire, milk or water to any one. They usually burn the dead, the
corpse being laid with the head to the south, though in some localities
the Hindu custom of placing the head to the north has been adopted.
They employ Br&#257;hmans for religious and ceremonial purposes. The
occupation of the caste is to breed and tend buffaloes and cattle, and
they also deal in live-stock, and sell milk, curds and <i>gh&#299;</i>.
They were formerly addicted to dacoity and cattle-theft. They have a
caste <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span><i>panch&#257;yat</i>, the head of which is
designated as <i>Mok&#257;si</i>. Formerly the <i>Mok&#257;si</i>
received Rs. 15 on the marriage of a widow, and Rs. 5 when a person
temporarily outcasted was readmitted to social intercourse, but these
payments are now only occasionally made. The caste drink liquor and eat
flesh, including pigs and fowls, but not beef. They employ
Br&#257;hmans for ceremonial purposes, but their social status is low
and they are practically on a level with the Dravidian tribes. The
dialect of Canarese spoken by the Golars is known as Golari, Holia or
Komtau, and is closely related to the form which that language assumes
in Bij&#257;pur;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2185src" href="#xd21e2185"

<p class="first"><b>Gond.</b>&mdash;The principal tribe of the
Dravidian family, and perhaps the most important of the non-Aryan or
forest tribes in India. In 1911 the Gonds were three million strong,
and they are increasing rapidly. The Kolis of western India count half
a million persons more than the Gonds, and if the four related tribes
Kol, Munda, Ho, and Sant&#257;l were taken together, they would be
stronger by about the same amount. But if historical importance be
considered as well as numbers, the first place should be awarded to the
Gonds. Of the whole caste the Central Provinces contain 2,300,000
persons, Central India, and Bih&#257;r and Orissa about 235,000 persons
each, and they are returned in small numbers from Assam, Madras and
Hyder&#257;b&#257;d. The 50,000 Gonds in Assam are no doubt immigrant
labourers on the tea-gardens.</p>

<h4 class="main">2. Gondw&#257;na.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Central Provinces the Gonds occupy two main
tracts. The first is the wide belt of broken hill and forest country in
the centre of the Province, which forms the Satp&#363;ra plateau, and
is mainly comprised in the Chhindw&#257;r&#257;, Bet&#363;l, Seoni and
Mandla Districts, with portions of several others adjoining them. And
the second is the still wider and more inaccessible mass of hill ranges
extending south of the Chhatt&#299;sgarh plain, and south-west down to
the God&#257;vari, which includes portions of the three
Chhatt&#299;sgarh Districts, the Bastar and Kanker States, and a great
part of Ch&#257;nda. In Mandla the Gonds form nearly half the
population, and in Bastar about two-thirds. There is, however, no
District or State of the Province which does not contain some Gonds,
and it is both on account of their numbers and the fact that Gond
dynasties possessed a great part of its area that the territory of the
Central Provinces was formerly known as Gondw&#257;na, or the country
of the Gonds.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2736src" href="#xd21e2736"
name="xd21e2736src">1</a> The existing importance of the Central
Provinces dates from recent years, for so late as 1853 it was stated
before the Royal Asiatic Society that &ldquo;at present the
Gondw&#257;na highlands <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>and jungles comprise such a large
tract of unexplored country that they form quite an oasis in our
maps.&rdquo; So much of this lately unexplored country as is British
territory is now fairly well served by railways, traversed almost
throughout by good roads, and provided with village schools at
distances of five to ten miles apart, even in the wilder tracts.</p>

<h4 class="main">3. Derivation of name and origin of the Gonds.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The derivation of the word Gond is uncertain. It is
the name given to the tribe by the Hindus or Muhammadans, as their own
name for themselves is Koit&#363;r or Koi. General Cunningham
considered that the name Gond probably came from Gauda, the classical
term for part of the United Provinces and Bengal. A Ben&#257;res
inscription relating to one of the Chedi kings of Tripura or Tewar
(near Jubbulpore) states that he was of the Haihaya tribe, who lived on
the borders of the Nerbudda in the district of the Western Gauda in the
Province of M&#257;lwa. Three or four other inscriptions also refer to
the kings of Gauda in the same locality. Gauda, however, was properly
and commonly used as the name of part of Bengal. There is no evidence
beyond a few doubtful inscriptions of its having ever been applied to
any part of the Central Provinces. The principal passage in which
General Cunningham identifies Gauda with the Central Provinces is that
in which the king of Gauda came to the assistance of the ruler of
M&#257;lwa against the king of Kanauj, elder brother of the great
Harsha Vardhana, and slew the latter king in <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 605. But Mr. V. A. Smith holds that Gauda in this
passage refers to Bengal and not to the Central Provinces;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2754src" href="#xd21e2754" name="xd21e2754src">2</a>
and General Cunningham&rsquo;s argument on the locality of Gauda is
thus rendered extremely dubious, and with it his derivation of the name
Gond. In fact it seems highly improbable that the name of a large tribe
should have been taken from a term so little used and known in this
special application. Though in the <i>Imperial Gazetteer</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2761src" href="#xd21e2761" name="xd21e2761src">3</a>
the present writer reproduced General Cunningham&rsquo;s derivation of
the term Gond, it was there characterised as speculative, and in the
light of the above remarks now seems highly improbable. Mr. Hislop
considered that the name Gond was a form of Kond, as he spelt the name
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>the Khond tribe. He pointed out that <i>k</i> and
<i>g</i> are interchangeable. Thus Gotalghar, the empty house where the
village young men sleep, comes from Kotal, a led horse, and
<i>ghar</i>, a house. Similarly, Koikop&#257;l, the name of a Gond
subtribe who tend cattle, is from Koi or Gond, and <i>gopal</i>, a
cowherd. The name by which the Gonds call themselves is Koi or
Koit&#363;r, while the Khonds call themselves Ku, which word Sir G.
Grierson considers to be probably related to the Gond name Koi.
Further, he states that the Telugu people call the Khonds, Gond or Kod
(Kor). General Cunningham points out that the word Gond in the Central
Provinces is frequently or, he says, usually pronounced Gaur, which is
practically the same sound as <i>god</i>, and with the change of
<i>G</i> to <i>K</i> would become Kod. Thus the two names Gond and Kod,
by which the Telugu people know the Khonds, are practically the same as
the names Gond and God of the Gonds in the Central Provinces, though
Sir G. Grierson does not mention the change of <i>g</i> to <i>k</i> in
his account of either language. It seems highly probable that the
designation Gond was given to the tribe by the Telugus. The Gonds speak
a Dravidian language of the same family as Tamil, Canarese and Telugu,
and therefore it is likely that they come from the south into the
Central Provinces. Their route may have been up the God&#257;vari river
into Ch&#257;nda; from thence up the Indravati into Bastar and the
hills south and east of the Chhatt&#299;sgarh plain; and up the Wardha
and Wainganga to the Districts of the Satp&#363;ra Plateau. In
Ch&#257;nda, where a Gond dynasty reigned for some centuries, they
would be in contact with the Telugus, and here they may have got their
name of Gond, and carried it with them into the north and east of the
Province. As already seen, the Khonds are called Gond by the Telugus,
and Kandh by the Uriyas. The Khonds apparently came up more towards the
east into Ganjam and K&#257;l&#257;handi. Here the name of Gond or Kod,
given them by the Telugus, may have been modified into Kandh by the
Uriyas, and from the two names came the English corruption of Khond.
The Khond and Gondi languages are now dissimilar. Still they present
certain points of resemblance, and though Sir G. Grierson does not
discuss their connection, it appears from his highly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>interesting genealogical tree of the Dravidian
languages that Khond or Kui and Gondi are closely connected. These two
languages, and no others, occupy an intermediate position between the
two great branches sprung from the original Dravidian language, one of
which is mainly represented by Telugu and the other by Tamil, Canarese
and Malay&#257;lam.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2797src" href=
"#xd21e2797" name="xd21e2797src">4</a> Gondi and Khond are shown in the
centre as the connecting link between the two great branches. Gondi is
more nearly related to Tamil and Khond to Telugu. On the Telugu side,
moreover, Khond approaches most closely to Kol&#257;mi, which is a
member of the Telugu branch. The Kol&#257;ms are a tribe of Wardha and
Ber&#257;r, sometimes considered an offshoot of the Gonds; at any rate,
it seems probable that they came from southern India by the same route
as the Gonds. Thus the Khond language is intermediate between Gondi and
the Kol&#257;mi dialect of Wardha and Ber&#257;r, though the
Kol&#257;ms live west of the Gonds and the Khonds east. And a fairly
close relationship between the three languages appears to be
established. Hence the linguistic evidence appears to afford strong
support to the view that the Khonds and Gonds may originally have been
one tribe. Further, Mr. Hislop points out that a word for god,
<i>pen</i>, is common to the Gonds and Khonds; and the Khonds have a
god called Bura Pen, who might be the same as Bura Deo, the great god
of the Gonds. Mr. Hislop found Kodo Pen and Pharsi Pen as Gond
gods,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2805src" href="#xd21e2805" name=
"xd21e2805src">5</a> while Pen or Pennu is the regular word for god
among the Khonds. This evidence seems to establish a probability that
the Gonds and Khonds were originally one tribe in the south of India,
and that they obtained separate names and languages since they left
their original home for the north. The fact that both of them speak
languages of the Dravidian family, whose home is in southern India,
makes it probable that the two tribes originally belonged there, and
migrated north into the Central Provinces and Orissa. This hypothesis
is supported by the traditions of the Gonds.</p>

<h4 class="main">4. History of the Gonds.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As stated in the article on Kol, it is known that
R&#257;jp&#363;t dynasties were ruling in various parts of the Central
Provinces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>from about the sixth to the twelfth centuries.
They then disappear, and there is a blank till the fourteenth century
or later, when Gond kingdoms are found established at Kherla in
Bet&#363;l, at Deogarh in Chh&#299;ndwara, at Garha-Mandla,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2817src" href="#xd21e2817" name="xd21e2817src">6</a>
including the Jubbulpore country, and at Ch&#257;nda, fourteen miles
from Bh&#257;ndak. It seems clear, then, that the Hindu dynasties were
subverted by the Gonds after the Muhammadan invasions of northern India
had weakened or destroyed the central powers of the Hindus, and
prevented any assistance being afforded to the outlying settlements.
There is some reason to suppose that the immigration of the Gonds into
the Central Provinces took place after the establishment of these Hindu
kingdoms, and not before, as is commonly held.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2820src" href="#xd21e2820" name="xd21e2820src">7</a> But the
point must at present be considered doubtful. There is no reason
however to doubt that the Gonds came from the south through Ch&#257;nda
and Bastar. During the fourteenth century and afterwards the Gonds
established dynasties at the places already mentioned in the Central
Provinces. For two or three centuries the greater part of the Province
was governed by Gond kings. Of their method of government in
Narsinghpur, Sleeman said: &ldquo;Under these Gond R&#257;jas the
country seems for the most part to have been distributed among
feudatory chiefs, bound to attend upon the prince at his capital with a
stipulated number of troops, to be employed wherever their services
might be required, but to furnish little or no revenue in money. These
chiefs were Gonds, and the countries they held for the support of their
families and the payment of their troops and retinue little more than
wild jungles. The Gonds seem not to have been at home in open country,
and as from the sixteenth century a peaceable penetration of Hindu
cultivators into the best lands of the Province assumed large
dimensions, the Gonds gradually retired to the hill ranges on the
borders of the plains.&rdquo; The headquarters of each dynasty at
Mandla, Garha, Kherla, Deogarh and Ch&#257;nda seem to have been
located in a position strengthened for defence either by a hill or a
great river, and adjacent to an especially fertile plain tract, whose
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>produce served for the maintenance of the
ruler&rsquo;s household and headquarters establishment. Often the site
was on other sides bordered by dense forest which would afford a
retreat to the occupants in case it fell to an enemy. Strong and
spacious forts were built, with masonry tanks and wells inside them to
provide water, but whether these buildings were solely the work of the
Gonds or constructed with the assistance of Hindu or Muhammadan
artificers is uncertain. But the Hindu immigrants found Gond government
tolerant and beneficent. Under the easy eventless sway of these princes
the rich country over which they ruled prospered, its flocks and herds
increased, and the treasury filled. So far back as the fifteenth
century we read in Firishta that the king of Kherla, who, if not a Gond
himself, was a king of the Gonds, sumptuously entertained the
B&#257;hmani king and made him rich offerings, among which were many
diamonds, rubies and pearls. Of the R&#257;ni D&#363;rgavati of
Garha-Mandla, Sleeman said: &ldquo;Of all the sovereigns of this
dynasty she lives most in the page of history and in the grateful
recollections of the people. She built the great reservoir which lies
close to Jubbulpore, and is called after her R&#257;ni Talao or
Queen&rsquo;s pond; and many other highly useful works were formed by
her about Garha.&rdquo; When the castle of Chaur&#257;garh was sacked
by one of Akbar&rsquo;s generals in 1564, the booty found, according to
Firishta, comprised, independently of jewels, images of gold and silver
and other valuables, no fewer than a hundred jars of gold coin and a
thousand elephants. Of the Ch&#257;nda rulers the Settlement officer
who has recorded their history wrote that, &ldquo;They left, if we
forget the last few years, a well-governed and contented kingdom,
adorned with admirable works of engineering skill and prosperous to a
point which no aftertime has reached. They have left their mark behind
them in royal tombs, lakes and palaces, but most of all in the seven
miles of battlemented stone wall, too wide now for the shrunk city of
Ch&#257;nda within it, which stands on the very border-line between the
forest and the plain, having in front the rich valley of the Wardha
river, and behind and up to the city walls deep forest extending to the
east.&rdquo; According to local tradition the great wall of Ch&#257;nda
and other buildings, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span>such as the tombs of the Gond kings and the
palace at Junona, were built by immigrant Telugu masons of the
K&#257;pu or Munurw&#257;r castes. Another excellent rule of the Gond
kings was to give to any one who made a tank a grant of land free of
revenue of the land lying beneath it. A large number of small
irrigation tanks were constructed under this inducement in the
Wainganga valley, and still remain. But the Gond states had no strength
for defence, as was shown when in the eighteenth century Mar&#257;tha
chiefs, having acquired some knowledge of the art of war and military
training by their long fighting against the Mughals, cast covetous eyes
on Gondw&#257;na. The loose tribal system, so easy in time of peace,
entirely failed to knit together the strength of the people when united
action was most required, and the plain country fell before the
Mar&#257;tha armies almost without a struggle. In the strongholds,
however, of the hilly ranges which hem in every part of Gondw&#257;na
the chiefs for long continued to maintain an unequal resistance, and to
revenge their own wrongs by indiscriminate rapine and slaughter. In
such cases the Mar&#257;tha plan was to continue pillaging and
harassing the Gonds until they obtained an acknowledgment of their
supremacy and the promise, at least, of an annual tribute. Under this
treatment the hill Gonds soon lost every vestige of civilisation, and
became the cruel, treacherous savages depicted by travellers of this
period. They regularly plundered and murdered stragglers and small
parties passing through the hills, while from their strongholds, built
on the most inaccessible spurs of the Satp&#363;ras, they would make a
dash into the rich plains of Ber&#257;r and the Nerbudda valley, and
after looting and killing all night, return straight across country to
their jungle fortresses, guided by the light of a bonfire on some
commanding peak.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2828src" href="#xd21e2828"
name="xd21e2828src">8</a> With the pacification of the country and the
introduction of a strong and equable system of government by the
British, these wild marauders soon settled down and became the timid
and inoffensive labourers which they now are.</p>

<h4 class="main">5. Mythica traditions. Story of Lingo.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mr. Hislop took down from a Pardh&#257;n priest a Gond
myth of the creation of the world and the origin of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>Gonds,
and their liberation from a cave, in which they had been shut up by
Siva, through the divine hero Lingo. General Cunningham said that the
exact position of the cave was not known, but it would seem to have
been somewhere in the Himalayas, as the name Dhawalgiri, which means a
white mountain, is mentioned. The cave, according to ordinary Gond
tradition, was situated in Kachikopa Loh&#257;garh or the Iron Valley
in the Red Hill. It seems clear from the story itself that its author
was desirous of connecting the Gonds with Hindu mythology, and as
Siva&rsquo;s heaven is in the Himalayas, the name Dhawalgiri, where he
located the cave, may refer to them. It is also said that the cave was
at the source of the Jumna. But in Mr. Hislop&rsquo;s version the cave
where all the Gonds except four were shut up is not in Kachikopa
Loh&#257;garh, as the Gonds commonly say; but only the four Gonds who
escaped wandered to this latter place and dwelt there. And the story
does not show that Kachikopa Loh&#257;garh was on Mount Dhawalgiri or
the Himalayas, where it places the cave in which the Gonds were shut
up, or anywhere near them. On the contrary, it would be quite consonant
with Mr. Hislop&rsquo;s version if Kachikopa Loh&#257;garh were in the
Central Provinces. It may be surmised that in the original Gond legend
their ancestors really were shut up in Kachikopa Loh&#257;garh, but not
by the god Siva. Very possibly the story began with them in the cave in
the Iron Valley in the Red Hill. But the Hindu who clearly composed Mr.
Hislop&rsquo;s version wished to introduce the god Siva as a principal
actor, and he therefore removed the site of the cave to the Himalayas.
This appears probable from the story itself, in which, in its present
form, Kachikopa Loh&#257;garh plays no real part, and only appears
because it was in the original tradition and has to be
retained.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2846src" href="#xd21e2846" name=
"xd21e2846src">9</a> But the Gonds think that their ancestors were
actually shut up in Kachikopa Loh&#257;garh, and one tradition puts the
site at Pachmarhi, whose striking hill scenery and red soil cleft by
many deep and inaccessible ravines would render it a likely place for
the incident. Another version locates Kachikopa Loh&#257;garh at
D&#257;rekasa <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>in Bhand&#257;ra, where there is a place known as
Kachagarh or the iron fort. But Pachmarhi is perhaps the more probable,
as it has some deep caves, which have always been looked upon as sacred
places. The point is of some interest, because this legend of the cave
being in the Himalayas is adduced as a Gond tradition that their
ancestors came from the north, and hence as supporting the theory of
the immigration of the Dravidians through the north-west of India. But
if the view now suggested is correct, the story of the cave being in
the Himalayas is not a genuine Gond tradition at all, but a Hindu
interpolation. The only other ground known to the writer for asserting
that the Gonds believed their ancestors to have come from the north is
that they bury their dead with the feet to the north. There are other
obvious Hindu accretions in the legend, as the saintly Br&#257;hmanic
character of Lingo and his overcoming the gods through fasting and
self-torture, and also the fact that Siva shut up the Gonds in the cave
because he was offended by their dirty habits and bad smell. But the
legend still contains a considerable quantity of true Gond tradition,
and though somewhat tedious, it seems necessary to give an abridgment
of Mr. Hislop&rsquo;s account, with reproduction of selected passages.
Captain Forsyth also made a modernised poetical version,<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the beginning there was water everywhere, and God
was born in a lotus-leaf and lived alone. One day he rubbed his arm and
from the rubbing made a crow, which sat on his shoulder; he also made a
crab, which swam out over the waters. God then ordered the crow to fly
over the world and bring some earth. The crow flew about and could find
no earth, but it saw the crab, which was supporting itself with one leg
resting on the bottom of the sea. The crow was very tired and perched
on the crab&rsquo;s back, which was soft so that the crow&rsquo;s feet
made marks on it, which are still visible on the bodies of all crabs at
present. The crow asked the crab where any earth could be found. The
crab said that if God would make its body hard it would find
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>some earth. God said he would make part of the
crab&rsquo;s body hard, and he made its back hard, as it still remains.
The crab then dived to the bottom of the sea, where it found Kenchna,
the earth-worm. It caught hold of Kenchna by the neck with its claws
and the mark thus made is still to be seen on the earth-worm&rsquo;s
neck. Then the earth-worm brought up earth out of its mouth and the
crab brought this to God, and God scattered it over the sea and patches
of land appeared. God then walked over the earth and a boil came on his
hand, and out of it Mah&#257;deo and P&#257;rvati were born.</p>

Br&#257;hman gods and twelve threshing-floors of Gond gods. All the
Gonds were scattered over the jungle. They behaved like Gonds and not
like good Hindus, with lamentable results, as follows:<a class=

</div>
<p class="first">Mah&#257;deo then determined to get rid of the Gonds.
With this view he invited them all to a meeting. When they sat
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=

rubbings of his body and let it loose in the middle of the Gonds. All
the Gonds at once got up and began to chase it, hoping for a meal. They
seized sticks and stones and clods of earth, and their unkempt hair
flew in the wind. The squirrel dodged about and ran away, and finally,
directed by Mah&#257;deo, ran into a large cave with all the Gonds
after it. Mah&#257;deo then rolled a large stone to the mouth of the
cave and shut up all the Gonds in it. Only four remained outside, and
they fled away to Kachikopa Loh&#257;garh, or the Iron Cave in the Red
Hill, and lived there. Meanwhile P&#257;rvati perceived that the smell
of the Gonds, which had pleased her, had vanished from Dhawalgiri. She
desired it to be restored and commenced a devotion. For six months she
fasted and practised austerities. Bhagw&#257;n (God) was swinging in a
swing. He was disturbed by P&#257;rvati&rsquo;s devotion. He sent
N&#257;r&#257;yan (the sun) to see who was fasting. N&#257;r&#257;yan
came and found P&#257;rvati and asked her what she wanted. She said
that she missed her Gonds and wanted them back. N&#257;r&#257;yan told
Bhagw&#257;n, who promised that they should be given back.</p>

<h4 class="main">8. The birth and history of Lingo.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The yellow flowers of the tree Pahindi were growing on
Dhawalgiri. Bhagw&#257;n sent thunder and lightning, and the flower
conceived. First fell from it a heap of turmeric or saffron. In the
morning the sun came out, the flower burst open, and Lingo was born.
Lingo was a perfect child. He had a diamond on his navel and a
sandalwood mark on his forehead. He fell from the flower into the heap
of turmeric. He played in the turmeric and slept in a swing. He became
nine years old. He said there was no one there like him, and he would
go where he could find his fellows. He climbed a needle-like
hill,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2921src" href="#xd21e2921" name=
"xd21e2921src">13</a> and from afar off he saw Kachikopa Loh&#257;garh
and the four Gonds. He came to them. They saw he was like them, and
asked him to be their brother. They ate only animals. Lingo asked them
to find for him an animal without a liver, and they searched all
through the forest and could not. Then Lingo told them to cut down
trees and make a field. They tried to cut down the
<i>anjan</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2926src" href="#xd21e2926"
name="xd21e2926src">14</a> trees, but their hands were blistered
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>and they could not go on. Lingo had been asleep.
He woke up and saw they had only cut down one or two trees. He took the
axe and cut down many trees, and fenced a field and made a gate to it.
Black soil appeared. It began to rain, and rained without ceasing for
three days. All the rivers and streams were filled. The field became
green with rice, and it grew up. There were sixteen score of
<i>n&#299;lgai</i> or blue-bull. They had two leaders, an old bull and
his nephew. The young bull saw the rice of Lingo&rsquo;s field and
wished to eat it. The uncle told him not to eat of the field of Lingo
or all the <i>n&#299;lgai</i> would be killed. But the young bull did
not heed, and took off all the <i>n&#299;lgai</i> to eat the rice. When
they got to the field they could find no entrance, so they jumped the
fence, which was five cubits high. They ate all the rice from off the
field and ran away. The young bull told them as they ran to put their
feet on leaves and stones and boughs and grass, and not on the ground,
so that they might not be tracked. Lingo woke up and went to see his
field, and found all the rice eaten. He knew the <i>n&#299;lgai</i> had
done it, and showed the brothers how to track them by the few marks
which they had by accident made on the ground. They did so, and
surrounded the <i>n&#299;lgai</i> and killed them all with their bows
and arrows except the old uncle, from whom Lingo&rsquo;s arrow
rebounded harmlessly on account of his innocence, and one young doe.
From these two the <i><span class="corr" id="xd21e2949" title=
"Source: nilgai">n&#299;lgai</span></i> race was preserved. Then Lingo
told the Gonds to make fire and roast the deer as follows:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">He said, I will show you something; see if anywhere in
your</p>
<p class="line">Waistbands there is a flint; if so, take it out and

this, a watch of the night passed.</p>
<p class="line">They threw down the matches, and said to Lingo, Thou
art a Saint;</p>
<p class="line">Show us where our fire is, and why it does not come
out.</p>
<p class="line">Lingo said: Three koss (six miles) hence is Rikad
Gaw&#257;di the giant.</p>
<p class="line">There is fire in his field; where smoke shall appear,
go there,</p>
<p class="line">Come not back without bringing fire. Thus said
Lingo.</p>
<p class="line">They said, We have never seen the place, where shall we
go?</p>
<p class="line">Ye have never seen where this fire is? Lingo said;</p>
<p class="line">I will discharge an arrow thither.</p>
<p class="line">Go in the direction of the arrow; there you will get
fire.</p>
<p class="line">He applied the arrow, and having pulled the bow, he
discharged one:</p>
<p class="line">It crashed on, breaking twigs and making its passage
clear. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Having cut through the high grass, it made its way and
reached the old man&rsquo;s place (above mentioned).</p>
<p class="line">The arrow dropped close to the fire of the old man, who
had daughters.</p>
<p class="line">The arrow was near the door. As soon as they saw it,
the daughters came and took it up,</p>
<p class="line">And kept it. They asked their father: When will you
give us in marriage?</p>
<p class="line">Thus said the seven sisters, the daughters of the old
man.</p>
<p class="line">I will marry you as I think best for you;</p>
<p class="line">Remain as you are. So said the old man, the Rikad
Gaw&#257;di.</p>
<p class="line">Lingo said, Hear, O brethren! I shot an arrow, it made
its way.</p>
<p class="line">Go there, and you will see fire; bring thence the
fire.</p>
<p class="line">Each said to the other, I will not go; but (at last)
the youngest went.</p>
<p class="line">He descried the fire, and went to it; then beheld he an
old man looking like the trunk of a tree.</p>
<p class="line">He saw from afar the old man&rsquo;s field, around
which a hedge was made.</p>
<p class="line">The old man kept only one way to it, and fastened a
screen to the entrance, and had a fire in the centre of the field.</p>
<p class="line">He placed logs of the Mahua and Anjun and S&#257;j
trees on the fire,</p>
<p class="line">Teak faggots he gathered, and enkindled flame.</p>
<p class="line">The fire blazed up, and warmed by the heat of it, in
deep sleep lay the Rikad Gaw&#257;di.</p>
<p class="line">Thus the old man like a giant did appear. When the
young Gond beheld him, he shivered;</p>
<p class="line">His heart leaped; and he was much afraid in his mind,
and said:</p>
<p class="line">If the old man were to rise he will see me, and I shall
be eaten up;</p>
<p class="line">I will steal away the fire and carry it off, then my
life will be safe.</p>
<p class="line">He went near the fire secretly, and took a brand of
<i>tendu</i> wood tree.</p>
<p class="line">When he was lifting it up a spark flew and fell on the
hip of the old man.</p>
<p class="line">That spark was as large as a pot; the giant was
blistered; he awoke alarmed.</p>
<p class="line">And said: I am hungry, and I cannot get food to eat
anywhere; I feel a desire for flesh;</p>
<p class="line">Like a tender cucumber hast thou come to me. So said
the old man to the Gond,</p>
<p class="line">Who began to fly. The old man followed him. The Gond
then threw away the brand which he had stolen.</p>
<p class="line">He ran onward, and was not caught. Then the old man,
being tired, turned back.</p>
<p class="line">Thence he returned to his field, and came near the fire
and sat, and said, What nonsense is this?</p>
<p class="line">A tender prey had come within my reach;</p>
<p class="line">I said I will cut it up as soon as I can, but it
escaped from my hand!</p>
<p class="line">Let it go; it will come again, then I will catch it. It
has gone now.</p>
<p class="line">Then what happened? the Gond returned and came to his
brethren.</p>
<p class="line">And said to them: Hear, O brethren, I went for fire, as
you sent me, to that field; I beheld an old man like a giant.</p>
<p class="line">With hands stretched out and feet lifted up. I ran. I
thus survived with difficulty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54"
href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">The brethren said to Lingo, We will not go. Lingo said,
Sit ye here.</p>
<p class="line">O brethren, what sort of a person is this giant? I will
go and see him.</p>
<p class="line">So saying, Lingo went away and reached a river.</p>
<p class="line">He thence arose and went onward. As he looked, he saw
in front three gourds.</p>
<p class="line">Then he saw a bamboo stick, which he took up.</p>
<p class="line">When the river was flooded</p>
<p class="line">It washed away a gourd tree, and its seed fell, and
each stem produced bottle-gourds.</p>
<p class="line">He inserted a bamboo stick in the hollow of the gourd
and made a guitar.</p>
<p class="line">He plucked two hairs from his head and strung it.</p>
<p class="line">He held a bow and fixed eleven keys to that one stick,
and played on it.</p>
<p class="line">Lingo was much pleased in his mind.</p>
<p class="line">Holding it in his hand, he walked in the direction of
the old man&rsquo;s field.</p>
<p class="line">He approached the fire where Rikad Gaw&#257;di was
sleeping.</p>
<p class="line">The giant seemed like a log lying close to the fire;
his teeth were hideously visible;</p>
<p class="line">His mouth was gaping. Lingo looked at the old man while
sleeping.</p>
<p class="line">His eyes were shut. Lingo said, This is not a good time
to carry off the old man while he is asleep.</p>
<p class="line">In front he looked, and turned round and saw a tree</p>
<p class="line">Of the p&#299;pal sort standing erect; he beheld its
branches with wonder, and looked for a fit place to mount upon.</p>
<p class="line">It appeared a very good tree; so he climbed it, and
ascended to the top of it to sit.</p>
<p class="line">As he sat the cock crew. Lingo said, It is
daybreak;</p>
<p class="line">Meanwhile the old man must be rising. Therefore Lingo
took the guitar in his hand,</p>
<p class="line">And held it; he gave a stroke, and it sounded well;
from it he drew one hundred tunes.</p>
<p class="line">It sounded well, as if he was singing with his
voice.</p>
<p class="line">Thus (as it were) a song was heard.</p>
<p class="line">Trees and hills were silent at its sound. The music
loudly entered into</p>
<p class="line">The old man&rsquo;s ears; he rose in haste, and sat up
quickly; lifted up his eyes,</p>
<p class="line">And desired to hear (more). He looked hither and
thither, but could not make out whence the sound came.</p>
<p class="line">The old man said: Whence has a creature come here
to-day to sing like the maina bird?</p>
<p class="line">He saw a tree, but nothing appeared to him as he looked
underneath it.</p>
<p class="line">He did not look up; he looked at the thickets and
ravines, but</p>
<p class="line">Saw nothing. He came to the road, and near to the fire
in the midst of his field and stood.</p>
<p class="line">Sometimes sitting, and sometimes standing, jumping, and
rolling, he began to dance.</p>
<p class="line">The music sounded as the day dawned. His old woman came
out in the morning and began to look out.</p>
<p class="line">She heard in the direction of the field a melodious
music playing.</p>
<p class="line">When she arrived near the edge of her field, she heard
music in her ears.</p>
<p class="line">That old woman called her husband to her.</p>
<p class="line"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">With stretched hands, and lifted feet, and with his
neck bent down, he danced.</p>
<p class="line">Thus he danced. The old woman looked towards her
husband, and said, My old man, my husband,</p>
<p class="line">Surely, that music is very melodious. I will dance,
said the old woman.</p>
<p class="line">Having made the fold of her dress loose, she quickly
began to dance near the hedge.</p>

<h4 class="main">9. Death and resurrection of Lingo.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then Lingo disclosed himself to the giant and became
friendly with him. The giant apologised for having tried to eat his
brother, and called Lingo his nephew. Lingo invited him to come and
feast on the flesh of the sixteen scores of <i>n&#299;lgai</i>. The
giant called his seven daughters and offered them all to Lingo in
marriage. The daughters produced the arrow which they had treasured up
as portending a husband. Lingo said he was not marrying himself, but he
would take them home as wives for his brothers. So they all went back
to the cave and Lingo assigned two of the daughters each to the three
elder brothers and one to the youngest. Then the brothers, to show
their gratitude, said that they would go and hunt in the forest and
bring meat and fruit and Lingo should lie in a swing and be rocked by
their seven wives. But while the wives were swinging Lingo and his eyes
were shut, they wished to sport with him as their husbands&rsquo;
younger brother. So saying they pulled his hands and feet till he woke
up. Then he reproached them and called them his mothers and sisters,
but they cared nothing and began to embrace him. Then Lingo was filled
with wrath and leapt up, and seeing a rice-pestle near he seized it and
beat them all with it soundly. Then the women went to their houses and
wept and resolved to be revenged on Lingo. So when the brothers came
home they told their husbands that while they were swinging Lingo he
had tried to seduce them all from their virtue, and they were resolved
to go home and stay no longer in Kachikopa with such a man about the
place. Then the brothers were exceedingly angry with Lingo, who they
thought had deceived them with a pretence of virtue in refusing a wife,
and they resolved to kill him. So they enticed him into the forest with
a story of a great animal which had put them to flight and asked him to
kill it, and there they shot him to death with their arrows and gouged
out his eyes and played ball with them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the god Bhagw&#257;n became aware that Lingo was not praying to
him as usual, and sent the crow Kageshwar to look for him. The crow
came and reported that Lingo was dead, and the god sent him back with
nectar to sprinkle it over the body and bring it to life again, which
was done.</p>

<p class="first">Lingo then thought he had had enough of the four
brothers, so he determined to go and find the other sixteen score Gonds
who were imprisoned somewhere as the brothers had told him. The manner

<p class="line">Screamed the panther in the forest,</p>
<p class="line">Growled the bear upon the mountain,</p>

<p class="line">Of their cannibal propensities.</p>
<p class="line">Saw at hand the tree Niruda,</p>
<p class="line">Clambered up into its branches.</p>
<p class="line">Darkness fell upon the forest,</p>

<p class="line">But the Moon sailed onwards, upwards,</p>

<p class="line">Said, &lsquo;Your Gonds, I have not seen them.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=

<p class="line">Eyes that look into the darkness,</p>
<p class="line">Tell me where my sixteen scores are.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">But the cold Stars twinkling ever,</p>

<p class="line">Broke the morning, the sky reddened,</p>
<p class="line">Faded out the star of morning,</p>
<p class="line">Rose the Sun above the forest,</p>
<p class="line">Brilliant Sun, the Lord of morning,</p>
<p class="line">And our Lingo quick descended,</p>
<p class="line">Quickly ran he to the eastward,</p>
<p class="line">Fell before the Lord of Morning,</p>
<p class="line">Gave the Great Sun salutation&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">&lsquo;Tell, O Sun!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Discover</p>
<p class="line">Where my sixteen scores of Gonds are.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="line">&ldquo;Hear, O Lingo, I a Pilgrim</p>

<p class="line">Then our Lingo wandered onwards</p>
<p class="line">Through the arches of the forest;</p>
<p class="line">Wandered on until before him</p>
<p class="line">Saw the grotto of a hermit,</p>
<p class="line">Old and sage, the Black Kum&#257;it,</p>

<p class="line">&ldquo;Lingo, hear, your Gonds are asses</p>

<p class="line">Our great Mah&#257;deva caught them,</p>

<p class="line">Back returned, and deeply pondered</p>
<p class="line">On the days that are forgotten,</p>
<p class="line">On the unremembered ages.</p>
<p class="line">But our Lingo wandered onwards,</p>
<p class="line">Fasting, praying, doing penance;</p>
<p class="line">Laid him on a bed of prickles,</p>
<p class="line">Thorns long and sharp and piercing.</p>
<p class="line">Fasting lay he devotee-like,</p>
<p class="line">Hand not lifting, foot not lifting,</p>
<p class="line">Eye not opening, nothing seeing.</p>
<p class="line">Twelve months long thus lay and fasted,</p>
<p class="line">Till his flesh was dry and withered,</p>
<p class="line">And the bones began to show through.</p>
<p class="line">Then the great god Mah&#257;deva</p>
<p class="line">Felt his seat begin to tremble,</p>
<p class="line">Felt his golden stool, all shaking</p>
<p class="line">From the penance of our Lingo.</p>
<p class="line">Felt, and wondered who on earth</p>
<p class="line">This devotee was that was fasting</p>
<p class="line">Till his golden stool was shaking.</p>
<p class="line">Stepped he down from Dewalgiri,</p>
<p class="line">Came and saw that bed of prickles</p>
<p class="line">Where our Lingo lay unmoving.</p>
<p class="line">Asked him what his little game was,</p>
<p class="line">Why his golden stool was shaking.</p>
<p class="line">Answered Lingo, &ldquo;Mighty Ruler!</p>
<p class="line">Nothing less will stop that shaking</p>
<p class="line">Than my sixteen scores of Koit&#363;rs</p>
<p class="line">Rendered up all safe and hurtless</p>
<p class="line">From your cave in Dewalgiri.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">Then the Great God, much disgusted,</p>
<p class="line">Offered all he had to Lingo,</p>
<p class="line">Offered kingdom, name, and riches,</p>
<p class="line">Offered anything he wished for,</p>
<p class="line">&lsquo;Only leave your stinking Koit&#363;rs</p>
<p class="line">Well shut up in Dewalgiri.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">But our Lingo all refusing</p>
<p class="line">Would have nothing but his Koit&#363;rs;</p>
<p class="line">Gave a turn to run the thorns a</p>
<p class="line">Little deeper in his midriff.</p>
<p class="line">Winced the Great God: &ldquo;Very well, then,</p>
<p class="line">Take your Gonds&mdash;but first a favour.</p>
<p class="line">By the shore of the Black Water</p>

<p class="line">Then our Lingo rose and wandered,</p>
<p class="line">Wandered onwards through the forest, <span class=

<p class="line">Till he reached the sounding sea-shore,</p>
<p class="line">Reached the brink of the Black Water,</p>
<p class="line">Found the Bingo birds were absent</p>
<p class="line">From their nest upon the sea-shore,</p>
<p class="line">Absent hunting in the forest,</p>
<p class="line">Hunting elephants prodigious,</p>
<p class="line">Which they killed and took their brains out,</p>
<p class="line">Cracked their skulls, and brought their brains to</p>
<p class="line">Feed their callow little Bindos,</p>
<p class="line">Wailing sadly by the sea-shore.</p>
<p class="line">Seven times a fearful serpent,</p>
<p class="line">Bhawarn&#257;g the horrid serpent,</p>
<p class="line">Serpent born in ocean&rsquo;s caverns,</p>
<p class="line">Coming forth from the Black Water,</p>
<p class="line">Had devoured the little Bindos&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Broods of callow little Bindos</p>
<p class="line">Wailing sadly by the sea-shore&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">In the absence of their parents.</p>
<p class="line">Eighth this brood was. Stood our Lingo,</p>
<p class="line">Stood he pondering beside them&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;If I take these little wretches</p>
<p class="line">In the absence of their parents</p>
<p class="line">They will call me thief and robber.</p>
<p class="line">No! I&rsquo;ll wait till they come back
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">Then he laid him down and slumbered</p>
<p class="line">By the little wailing Bindos.</p>
<p class="line">As he slept the dreadful serpent,</p>
<p class="line">Rising, came from the Black Water,</p>
<p class="line">Came to eat the callow Bindos,</p>
<p class="line">In the absence of their parents.</p>
<p class="line">Came he trunk-like from the waters,</p>
<p class="line">Came with fearful jaws distended,</p>
<p class="line">Huge and horrid, like a basket</p>
<p class="line">For the winnowing of corn.</p>
<p class="line">Rose a hood of vast dimensions</p>
<p class="line">O&rsquo;er his fierce and dreadful visage.</p>
<p class="line">Shrieked the Bindos young and callow,</p>
<p class="line">Gave a cry of lamentation;</p>
<p class="line">Rose our Lingo; saw the monster;</p>
<p class="line">Drew an arrow from his quiver,</p>
<p class="line">Shot it swift into his stomach,</p>
<p class="line">Sharp and cutting in the stomach,</p>
<p class="line">Then another and another;</p>
<p class="line">Cleft him into seven pieces,</p>
<p class="line">Wriggled all the seven pieces,</p>
<p class="line">Wriggled backward to the water.</p>
<p class="line">But our Lingo, swift advancing,</p>
<p class="line">Seized the headpiece in his arms,</p>
<p class="line">Knocked the brains out on a boulder;</p>
<p class="line">Laid it down beside the Bindos, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Callow, wailing, little Bindos.</p>
<p class="line">On it laid him, like a pillow,</p>
<p class="line">And began again to slumber.</p>
<p class="line">Soon returned the parent Bindos</p>
<p class="line">From their hunting in the forest;</p>
<p class="line">Bringing brains and eyes of camels</p>
<p class="line">And of elephants prodigious,</p>
<p class="line">For their little callow Bindos</p>
<p class="line">Wailing sadly by the sea-shore.</p>
<p class="line">But the Bindos young and callow</p>
<p class="line">Brains of camels would not swallow;</p>
<p class="line">Said&mdash;&ldquo;A pretty set of parents</p>
<p class="line">You are truly! thus to leave us</p>
<p class="line">Sadly wailing by the sea-shore</p>
<p class="line">To be eaten by the serpent&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Bhawarn&#257;g the dreadful serpent&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Came he up from the Black Water,</p>
<p class="line">Came to eat us little Bindos,</p>
<p class="line">When this very valiant Lingo</p>
<p class="line">Shot an arrow in his stomach,</p>
<p class="line">Cut him into seven pieces&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Give to Lingo brains of camels,</p>
<p class="line">Eyes of elephants prodigious.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">Then the fond paternal Bindo</p>
<p class="line">Saw the head-piece of the serpent</p>
<p class="line">Under Lingo&rsquo;s head a pillow,</p>
<p class="line">And he said, &lsquo;O valiant Lingo,</p>
<p class="line">Ask whatever you may wish for.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">Then he asked the little Bindos</p>
<p class="line">For an offering to the Great God,</p>
<p class="line">And the fond paternal Bindo,</p>
<p class="line">Much disgusted first refusing,</p>
<p class="line">Soon consented; said he&rsquo;d go too</p>
<p class="line">With the fond maternal Bindo&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Take them all upon his shoulders,</p>
<p class="line">And fly straight to Dewalgiri.</p>
<p class="line">Then he spread his mighty pinions,</p>
<p class="line">Took his Bindos up on one side</p>
<p class="line">And our Lingo on the other.</p>
<p class="line">Thus they soared away together</p>
<p class="line">From the shores of the Black Water,</p>
<p class="line">And the fond maternal Bindo,</p>
<p class="line">O&rsquo;er them hovering, spread an awning</p>
<p class="line">With her broad and mighty pinions</p>
<p class="line">O&rsquo;er her offspring and our Lingo.</p>
<p class="line">By the forests and the mountains</p>
<p class="line">Six months&rsquo; journey was it thither</p>
<p class="line">To the mountain Dewalgiri.</p>
<p class="line">Half the day was scarcely over</p>
<p class="line">Ere this convoy from the sea-shore <span class=

<p class="line">&ldquo;Lo, this very valiant Lingo!</p>
<p class="line">Here he is with all the Bindos,</p>
<p class="line">The Black Bindos from the sea-shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">Then the Great God, much disgusted,</p>
<p class="line">Driven quite into a corner,</p>
<p class="line">Took our Lingo to the cavern,</p>
<p class="line">Sent Basm&#257;sur to his kennel,</p>
<p class="line">Held his nose, and moved away the</p>
<p class="line">Mighty stone of sixteen cubits;</p>
<p class="line">Called those sixteen scores of Gonds out</p>
<p class="line">Made them over to their Lingo.</p>
<p class="line">And they said, &ldquo;O Father Lingo!</p>
<p class="line">What a bad time we&rsquo;ve had of it,</p>
<p class="line">Not a thing to fill our bellies</p>
<p class="line">In this horrid gloomy dungeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">But our Lingo gave them dinner,</p>
<p class="line">Gave them rice and flour of millet,</p>
<p class="line">And they went off to the river,</p>
<p class="line">Had a drink, and cooked and ate it.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The next episode is taken from a slightly different
local version:</p>
<p>And while they were cooking their food at the river a great flood
came up, but all the Gonds crossed safely except the four gods,
Tek&#257;m, Mark&#257;m, Pus&#257;m and Teleng&#257;m.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3712src" href="#xd21e3712" name=
"xd21e3712src">16</a> These were delayed because they had cooked their
food with <i>gh&#299;</i> which they had looted from the Hindu deities.
Then they stood on the bank and cried out,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O God of the crossing,</p>
<p class="line">O Boundary God!</p>
<p class="line">Should you be here,</p>
<p class="line">Come take us across.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Hearing this, the tortoise and crocodile came up to
them, and offered to take them across the river. So Mark&#257;m and
Tek&#257;m sat on the back of the crocodile and Pus&#257;m and
Teleng&#257;m on the back of the tortoise, and before starting the gods
made the crocodile and tortoise swear that they would not eat or drown
them in the sea. But when they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>got to the middle of the river
the tortoise and crocodile began to sink, with the idea that they would
drown the Gonds and feed their young with them. Then the Gonds cried
out, and the Raig&#299;dhni or vulture heard them. This bird appears to
be the same as the Bindo, as it fed its young with elephants. The
Raig&#299;dhni flew to the Gonds and took them up on its back and flew
ashore with them. And in its anger it picked out the tongue of the
crocodile and crushed the neck of the tortoise. And this is why the
crocodile is still tongueless and the tortoise has a broken neck, which
is sometimes inside and sometimes outside its shell. Both animals also
have the marks of string on their backs where the Gond gods tied their
necks together when they were ferried across. Thus all the Gonds were
happily reunited and Lingo took them into the forest, and they founded
a town there, which grew and prospered. And Lingo divided all the Gonds
into clans and made the oldest man a Pardh&#257;n or priest and founded
the rule of exogamy. He also made the Gond gods, subsequently
described,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3731src" href="#xd21e3731" name=
"xd21e3731src">17</a> and worshipped them with offerings of a calf and
liquor, and danced before them. He also prescribed the ceremonies of
marriage which are still observed, and after all this was done Lingo
went to the gods.</p>

<h4 class="main">11. Subcastes.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Out of the Gond tribe, which, as it gave its name to a
province, may be considered as almost a people, a number of separate
castes have naturally developed. Among them are several occupational
castes such as the Agarias or iron-workers, the Ojhas or soothsayers,
Pardh&#257;ns or priests and minstrels, Sol&#257;has or carpenters, and
Koilabhutis or dancers or prostitutes. These are principally sprung
from the Gonds, though no doubt with an admixture of other low tribes
or castes. The Parjas of Bastar, now classed as a separate tribe,
appear to represent the oldest Gond settlers, who were subdued by later
immigrants of the race; while the Bhatras and Jh&#257;di Telengas are
of mixed descent from Gonds and Hindus. Similarly the Gow&#257;ri caste
of cattle-graziers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63"
name="pb63">63</a>]</span>originated from the alliances of Gond and
Ah&#299;r graziers. The Mannew&#257;rs and Kol&#257;ms are other tribes
allied to the Gonds. Many Hindu castes and also non-Aryan tribes living
in contact with the Gonds have a large Gond element; of the former
class the Ah&#299;rs, Basors, Barhais and Loh&#257;rs, and of the
latter the Baigas, Bhunjias and Khairw&#257;rs are instances.</p>
<p>Among the Gonds proper there are two aristocratic subdivisions, the
R&#257;j-Gonds and Khatolas. According to Forsyth the R&#257;j-Gonds
are in many cases the descendants of alliances between R&#257;jp&#363;t
adventurers and Gonds. But the term practically comprises the
landholding subdivision of the Gonds, and any proprietor who was
willing to pay for the privilege could probably get his family admitted
into the R&#257;j-Gond group. The R&#257;j-Gonds rank with the Hindu
cultivating castes, and Br&#257;hmans will take water from them. They
sometimes wear the sacred thread. In the Telugu country the
R&#257;j-Gond is known as Durla or Durlasattam. In some localities
R&#257;j-Gonds will intermarry with ordinary Gonds, but not in others.
The Khatola Gonds take their name from the Khatola state in
Bundelkhand, which is said to have once been governed by a Gond ruler,
but is no longer in existence. In Saugor they rank about equal with the
R&#257;j-Gonds and intermarry with them, but in Chhindw&#257;ra it is
said that ordinary Gonds despise them and will not marry with them or
eat with them on account of their mixed descent from Gonds and Hindus.
The ordinary Gonds in most Districts form one endogamous group, and are
known as the Dhur or &lsquo;dust&rsquo; Gonds, that is the common
people. An alternative name conferred on them by the Hindus is
R&#257;wanvansi or of the race of R&#257;wan, the demon king of Ceylon,
who was the opponent of R&#257;ma. The inference from this name is that
the Hindus consider the Gonds to have been among the people of southern
India who opposed the Aryan expedition to Ceylon, which is preserved in
the legend of R&#257;ma; and the name therefore favours the hypothesis
that the Gonds came from the south and that their migration northward
was sufficiently recent in date to permit of its being still remembered
in tradition. There are several other small local subdivisions. The
Koya Gonds live on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64"
name="pb64">64</a>]</span>border of the Telugu country, and their name
is apparently a corruption of Koi or Koit&#363;r, which the Gonds call
themselves. The Gaita are another Ch&#257;nda subcaste, the word Gaite
or Gaita really meaning a village priest or headman. Gattu or Gotte is
said to be a name given to the hill Gonds of Ch&#257;nda, and is not a
real subcaste. The Darwe or N&#257;ik Gonds of Ch&#257;nda were
formerly employed as soldiers, and hence obtained the name of Na&#299;k
or leader. Other local groups are being formed such as the Larhia or
those of Chhatt&#299;sgarh, the Mandl&#257;ha of Mandla, the
L&#257;njiha from L&#257;nji and so on. These are probably in course of
becoming endogamous. The Gonds of Bastar are divided into two groups,
the M&#257;ria and the Muria. The M&#257;ria are the wilder, and are
apparently named after the Mad, as the hilly country of Bastar is
called. Mr. H&#299;ra L&#257;l suggests the derivation of Muria from
<i>mur</i>, the <i>pal&#257;s</i> tree, which is common in the plains
of Bastar, or from <i>mur</i>, a root. Both derivations must be
considered as conjectural. The Murias are the Gonds who live in the
plains and are more civilised than the M&#257;rias. The descendants of
the R&#257;ja of Deogarh Bakht Buland, who turned Muhammadan, still
profess that religion, but intermarry freely with the Hindu Gonds. The
term Bhoi, which literally means a bearer in Telugu, is used as a
synonym for the Gonds and also as an honorific title. In
Chhindw&#257;ra it is said that only a village proprietor is addressed
as Bhoi. It appears that the Gonds were used as palanquin-bearers, and
considered it an honour to belong to the Kah&#257;r or bearer caste,
which has a fairly good status.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3767src"

<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e3770">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">12. Exogamy.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gond rules of exogamy appear to preserve traces of
the system found in Australia, by which the whole tribe is split into
two or four main divisions, and every man in one or two of them must
marry a woman in the other one or two. This is considered by Sir J. G.
Frazer to be the beginning of exogamy, by which marriage was
prohibited, first, between brothers and sisters, and then between
parents and children, by the arrangement of these main
divisions.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3775src" href="#xd21e3775" name=
"xd21e3775src">19</a></p>
<p>Among the Gonds, however, the subdivision into small exogamous septs
has been also carried out, and the class <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>system, if the surmise
that it once existed be correct, remains only in the form of a
survival, prohibiting marriage between agnates, like an ordinary sept.
In one part of Bastar all the septs of the M&#257;ria Gonds are divided
into two great classes. There are ninety septs in A Class and
sixty-nine in B Class, though the list may be incomplete. All the septs
of A Class say that they are Bhaiband or D&#257;dabhai to each other,
that is in the relation of brothers, or cousins being the sons of
brothers. No man of Class A can marry a woman of any sept in Class A.
The septs of Class A stand in relation of M&#257;mabhai or Akom&#257;ma
to those of Class B. M&#257;mabhai means a maternal uncle&rsquo;s son,
and Akom&#257;ma apparently signifies having the same maternal
grandfather. Any man of a sept in Class A can marry any woman of a sept
in Class B. It will thus be seen that the smaller septs seem to serve
no purpose for regulating marriage, and are no more than family names.
The tribe might just as well be divided into two great exogamous clans
only. Marriage is prohibited between persons related only through
males; but according to the exogamous arrangement there is no other
prohibition, and a man could marry any maternal relative. Separate
rules, however, prohibit his marriage with certain female relatives,
and these will be given subsequently.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3785src" href="#xd21e3785" name="xd21e3785src">20</a> It is
possible that the small septs may serve some purpose which has not been
elicited, though the inquiry made by Rai Bah&#257;dur Panda
Baijn&#257;th was most careful and painstaking.</p>
<p>In another part of Bastar there were found to be five classes, and
each class had a small number of septs in it. The people who supplied
this information could not give the names of many septs. Thus Class A
had six septs, Class B five, Classes C and D one each, Class E four,
and Class F two. A man could not marry a woman of any sept belonging to
his own class.</p>
<p>The Muria Gonds of Bastar have a few large exogamous septs or clans
named in Hindi after animals, and each of these clans contains several
subsepts with Gondi names. Thus the <i>Bakaravans</i> or Goat race
contains the Garde, Kunjami, Karrami and Vadde septs. The
<i>Kachhimvans</i> or Tortoise race has the Net&#257;mi, Kawachi,
Usendi and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>Tek&#257;mi septs; the <i>N&#257;gvans</i> or
Cobra race includes the Mar&#257;vi, Pot&#257;ri, Karanga, Nurethi,
Dhurwa and others. Other exogamous races are the Sodi (or tiger),
Behainsa (buffalo), Net&#257;m (dog in Gondi), Chamchidai (bat) and one
or two more. In this case the exogamous clans with Hindi names would
appear to be a late division, and have perhaps been adopted because the
meaning of the old Gondi names had been forgotten, or the septs were
too numerous to be remembered.</p>
<p>In Ch&#257;nda a classification according to the number of gods
worshipped is found. There are four main groups worshipping seven, six,
five and four gods respectively, and each group contains ten to fifteen
septs. A man cannot marry a woman of any sept which worships the same
number of gods as himself. Each group has a sacred animal which the
members revere, that of the seven-god worshippers being a porcupine, of
the six-god worshippers a tiger, of the five-god worshippers the
s&#257;ras crane, and of the four-god worshippers a tortoise. As a rule
the members of the different groups do not know the names of their
gods, and in practice it is doubtful whether they restrict themselves
to the proper number of gods of their own group. Formerly there were
three-, two- and one-god worshippers, but in each of these classes it
is said that there were only one or two septs, and they found that they
were much inconvenienced by the paucity of their numbers, perhaps for
purposes of communal worship and feasting, and hence they got
themselves enrolled in the larger groups. In reality it would appear
that the classification according to the number of gods worshipped is
being forgotten, and the three lowest groups have disappeared. This
conjecture is borne out by the fact that in Chhindw&#257;ra and other
localities only two large classes remain who worship six and seven gods
respectively, and marry with each other, the union of a man with a
woman worshipping the same number of gods as himself being prohibited.
Here, again, the small septs included in the groups appear to serve no
purpose for regulating marriages. In Mandla the division according to
the number of gods worshipped exists as in Ch&#257;nda; but many Gonds
have forgotten all particulars as to the gods, and say only that those
septs which worship <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67"
name="pb67">67</a>]</span>the same number of gods are <i>bhaiband</i>,
or related to each other, and therefore cannot intermarry. In
Bet&#363;l the division by numbers of gods appears to be wholly in
abeyance. Here certain large septs, especially the Uika and Dhurwa, are
subdivided into a number of subsepts, within each of which marriage is
prohibited.</p>

<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e3812">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">13. Totemism.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many of the septs are named after animals and plants.
Among the commonest septs in all Districts are Mark&#257;m, the mango
tree; Tek&#257;m, the teak tree; Net&#257;m, the dog; Irp&#257;chi, the
mahua tree; Tumr&#257;chi, the tendu tree; Warkara, the wild cat, and
so on. Generally the members of a sept do not kill or injure their
totem animals, but the rule is not always observed, and in some cases
they now have some other object of veneration, possibly because they
have forgotten the meaning of the sept name, or the object after which
it is named has ceased to be sacred. Thus the Mark&#257;m sept, though
named after the mango, now venerate the tortoise, and this is also the
case with the Net&#257;m sept in Bastar, though named after the dog. In
Bastar a man revering the tortoise, though he will not catch the animal
himself, will get one of his friends to catch it, and one revering the
goat, if he wishes to kill a goat for a feast, will kill it not at his
own house but at a friend&rsquo;s. The meaning of the important sept
names Mar&#257;bi, Dhurwa and Uika has not been ascertained, and the
members of the sept do not know it. In Mandla the Mar&#257;bi sept are
divided into the Eti Mar&#257;bi and Padi Mar&#257;bi, named after the
goat and pig. The Eti or goat Mar&#257;bi will not touch a goat nor
sacrifice one to Bura Deo. They say that once their ancestors stole a
goat and were caught by the owner, when they put a basket over it and
prayed Bura Deo to change it into a pig, which he did. Therefore they
sacrifice only pigs to Bura Deo, but apparently the Padi Mar&#257;bi
also both sacrifice and eat pigs. The Dhurwa sept are divided into the
Tumr&#257;chi and N&#257;balia Dhurwa, named after the tendu tree and
the dwarf date-palm. The N&#257;balia Dhurwas will not cut a dwarf
date-palm nor eat its fruit. They worship Bura Deo in this tree instead
of in the s&#257;j tree, making an iron doll to represent him and
covering it with palm-leaves. The Uika sept in Mandla say that they
revere no animal or plant, and can eat any animal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>or cut
down any plant except the <i>s&#257;j</i> tree,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3822src" href="#xd21e3822" name="xd21e3822src">21</a> the tree of
Bura Deo; but in Bet&#363;l they are divided into several subsepts,
each of which has a totem. The Parteti sept revere the crocodile. When
a marriage is finished they make a sacrifice to the crocodile, and if
they see one lying dead they break their earthen pots in token of
mourning. The Warkara sept revere the wild cat; they also will not
touch a village cat nor keep one in their house, and if a cat comes in
they drive it out at once. The Kunj&#257;m sept revere the rat and do
not kill it.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">14. Connection of totemism with the gods.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Bet&#363;l the Gonds explain the totemistic names
of their septs by saying that some incident connected with the animal,
tree or other object occurred to the ancestor or priest of the sept
while they were worshipping at the Deo-khulla or god&rsquo;s place or
threshing-floor. Mr. Ganga Pras&#257;d Khatri has made an interesting
collection of these. The reason why these stories have been devised may
be that the totem animals or plants have ceased to be revered on their
own merits as ancestors or kinsmen of the sept, and it was therefore
felt necessary to explain the sept name or sanctity attaching to the
totem by associating it with the gods. If this were correct the process
would be analogous to that by which an animal or plant is first held
sacred of itself, and, when this feeling begins to decay with some
recognition of its true nature, it is associated with an
anthropomorphic god in order to preserve its sanctity. The following
are some examples recorded by Mr. Ganga Pras&#257;d Khatri. Some of the
examples are not associated with the gods.</p>
<p><i>Gajj&#257;mi</i>, subsept of Dhurwa sept. From <i>gaj</i>, an
arrow. Their first ancestor killed a tiger with an arrow.</p>
<p><i>Gouribans Dhurwa.</i> Their first ancestor worshipped his gods in
a bamboo clump.</p>
<p><i>Kusadya Dhurwa.</i> (<i>Kosa</i>, tasar silk cocoon.) The first
ancestor found a silk cocoon on the tree in which he worshipped his
gods.</p>
<p><i>Kohkapath.</i> <i>Kohka</i> is the fruit of the
<i>bhilawa</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3858src" href="#xd21e3858"
name="xd21e3858src">22</a> or marking-nut tree, and <i>path</i>, a kid.
The first ancestor worshipped his gods in a <i>bhilawa</i> tree and
offered a kid to them. Members of this sept do not eat the fruit or
flowers of the <i>bhilawa</i> tree. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69"
href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Jaglya.</i> One who keeps awake, or the awakener. The first
ancestor stayed awake the whole night in the Deo-khulla, or god&rsquo;s
threshing-floor.</p>
<p><i>Sariy&#257;m.</i> (<i>Sarri</i>, a path.) The first ancestor
swept the path to the Deo-khulla.</p>
<p><i>Gudd&#257;m.</i> Gudda is a place where a hen lays her eggs. The
first ancestor&rsquo;s hen laid eggs in the Deo-khulla.</p>
<p><i>Irp&#257;chi.</i> The mahua tree. A mahua tree grew in the
Deo-khulla or worshipping-place of this sept.</p>
<p><i>Admachi.</i> The <i>dhaura</i> tree.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3902src" href="#xd21e3902" name="xd21e3902src">23</a> The first
ancestor worshipped his gods under a <i>dhaura</i> tree. Members of the
sept do not cut this tree nor burn its wood.</p>
<p><i>Sar&#257;ti Dhurwa.</i> (<i>Sar&#257;ti</i>, a whip.) The first
ancestor whipped the priest of the gods.</p>
<p><i>Suibadiwa.</i> (<i>Sui</i>, a porcupine.) The first
ancestor&rsquo;s wife had a porcupine which went and ate the crop of an
old man&rsquo;s field. He tried to catch it, but it went back to her.
He asked the name of her sept, and not being able to find it out called
it Suibadiwa.</p>
<p><i>Watka.</i> (A stone.) Members of this sept worship five stones
for their gods. Some say that the first ancestors were young boys who
forgot where the Deo-khulla was and therefore set up five stones and
offered a chicken to them. As they did not offer the usual sacrifice of
a goat, members of this sept abstain from eating goats.</p>
<p><i>Tumrecha Uika.</i> (The <i>tendu</i> tree.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3935src" href="#xd21e3935" name="xd21e3935src">24</a>) It is said
that the original ancestor of this sept was walking in the forest with
his pregnant wife. She saw some <i>tendu</i> fruit and longed for it
and he gave it to her to eat. Perhaps the original idea may have been
that she conceived through swallowing a <i>tendu</i> fruit. Members of
this sept eat the fruit of the <i>tendu</i> tree, but do not cut the
tree nor make any use of its leaves or branches.</p>
<p><i>Tumdan Uika.</i> Tumdan is a kind of pumpkin or gourd. They say
that this plant grows in their Deo-khulla. The members drink water out
of this gourd in the house, but do not carry it out of the house.</p>
<p><i>Kadfa-chor Uika.</i> (Stealer of the <i>kadfa</i>.) <i>Kadfa</i>
is the sheaf of grain left standing in the field for the gods when
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>the crop is cut. The first ancestor stole the
<i>kadfa</i> and offered it to his gods.</p>
<p><i>Gadham&#257;r Uika.</i> (Donkey-slayer.) Some say that the gods
of the sept came to the Deo-khulla riding on donkeys, and others that
the first ancestor killed a donkey in the Deo-khulla.</p>
<p><i>Eti-kumra.</i> Eti is a goat. The ancestors of the sept used to
sacrifice a Br&#257;hman boy to their gods. Once they were caught in
the act by the parents of the boy they had stolen, and they prayed to
the gods to save them, and the boy was turned into a goat. They do not
kill a goat nor eat its flesh, nor sacrifice it to the gods.</p>
<p><i>Ahke.</i> This word means &lsquo;on the other side of a
river.&rsquo; They say that a man of the Dhurwa sept abducted a girl of
the Uika sept from the other side of a river and founded this sept.</p>
<p><i>Tirg&#257;m.</i> The word means fire. They say that their
ancestor&rsquo;s hand was burnt in the Deo-khulla while cooking the
sacrifice.</p>
<p><i>Tek&#257;m.</i> (The teak tree.) The ancestor of the sept had his
gods in this tree. Members of the sept will not eat food off teak
leaves, but they will use them for thatching, and also cut the
tree.</p>
<p><i>Manapa.</i> In Gondi <i>mani</i> is a son and <i>apa</i> a
father. They say that their ancestors sacrificed a Br&#257;hman father
and son to their gods and were saved by their being turned into goats
like the Eti-kumra sept. Members of the sept do not kill or eat a
goat.</p>
<p><i>Korpachi.</i> The droppings of a hen. The ancestors of the sept
offered these to his gods.</p>
<p><i>Mandani.</i> The female organ of generation. The ancestor of the
sept slept with his wife in the Deo-khulla.</p>
<p><i>Paiy&#257;m.</i> <i>Paiya</i> is a heifer which has not borne a
calf, such as is offered to the gods. Other Gonds say that the people
of this sept have no gods. They are said not only to marry a girl from
any other subsept of the Dhurwas and Uikas, but from their own sept and
even their own sisters, though this is probably no longer true. They
are held to be the lowest of the Gonds. Except in this instance, as
already seen, the subsepts of the Dhurwa and Uika septs do not
intermarry with each other. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href=

<p class="first">A man must not marry in his own sept, nor in one which

common; this is held to be a survival of the matriarchate, when a
man&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son was his heir. But the reason has now
been generally forgotten, and the union of a brother&rsquo;s son to a
sister&rsquo;s daughter has also become customary, while, as girls are
scarce and have to be paid for, it is the boy&rsquo;s father who puts
forward his claim. Thus in Mandla and Bastar a man thinks he has a
right to his sister&rsquo;s daughter for his son on the ground that his
family has given a girl to her husband&rsquo;s family, and therefore
they should give one back. This match is known as <i>D&#363;dh
laut&#257;na</i> or bringing back the milk; and if the sister&rsquo;s
daughter marries any one else her maternal uncle sometimes claims what
is known as &lsquo;milk money,&rsquo; which may be a sum of Rs. 5, in
compensation for the loss of the girl as a wife for his son. This
custom has perhaps developed out of the former match in changed
conditions of society, when the original relation between a brother and
his sister&rsquo;s son has been forgotten and girls have become
valuable. But it is said that the <i>d&#363;dh</i> or milk money is
also payable if a brother refuses to give his daughter to his
sister&rsquo;s son. In Mandla a man claims his sister&rsquo;s daughter
for his son and sometimes even the daughter of a cousin, and considers
that he has a legitimate grievance if the girl is married to somebody
else. Frequently, if he has reason to apprehend this, he invites the
girl to his house for some ceremony or festival, and there marries her
to his son without the consent of her parents. As this usually
constitutes the offence of kidnapping under the Penal Code, a crop of
criminal cases results, but the procedure of arrest without warrant and
the severe punishment imposed by the Code are somewhat unsuitable for a
case of this kind, which, according to Gond ideas, is rather in the
nature of a civil <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72"
name="pb72">72</a>]</span>wrong, and a sufficient penalty would often
be the payment of an adequate compensation or bride-price for the girl.
The children of two sisters cannot, it is said, be married, and a man
cannot marry his wife&rsquo;s elder sister, any aunt or niece, nor his
mother-in-law or her sister. But marriage is not prohibited between
grandparents and grandchildren. If an old man marries a young wife and
dies, his grandson will marry her if she is of proper age. In this
there would be no blood-relationship, but it is doubtful whether even
the existence of such relationship would prevent the match. It is said
that even among Hindu castes the grandfather will flirt with his
granddaughter, and call her his wife in jest, and the grandmother with
her grandson. In Bastar a man can marry his daughter&rsquo;s daughter
or maternal grandfather&rsquo;s or grandmother&rsquo;s sister. He could
not marry his son&rsquo;s daughter or paternal grandfather&rsquo;s
sister, because they belong to the same sept as himself.</p>

<h4 class="main">16. Irregular marriages.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the M&#257;ria country, if a girl is made pregnant
by a man of the caste before marriage, she simply goes to his house and
becomes his wife. This is called <i>Paithu</i> or entering. The man has
to spend Rs. 2 or 3 on food for the caste and pay the price for the
girl to her parents. If a girl has grown up and no match has been
arranged for her to which she agrees, her parents will ask her maternal
uncle&rsquo;s or paternal aunt&rsquo;s son to seize her and take her
away. These two cousins have a kind of prescriptive claim to the girl,
and apparently it makes no difference whether the prospective husband
is already married or not. He and his friends lie in wait near her home
and carry her off, and her parents afterwards proceed to his house to
console their daughter and reconcile her to the match. Sometimes when a
woman is about to become what is known as a Paisamundi or kept woman,
without being married, the relations rub her and the man whose mistress
she is with oil and turmeric, put marriage crowns of palm-leaves on
their heads, pour water on them from the top of a post, and make them
go seven times round a mahua branch, so that they may be considered to
be married. When a couple are very poor they may simply go and live
together without any wedding, and perform the ceremony afterwards when
they have means, or they distribute little <span class=

of bread to the tribesmen in lieu of the marriage feast.</p>

<h4 class="main">17. Marriage. Arrangement of matches.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage is generally adult. Among the wild M&#257;ria
Gonds of Bastar the consent of the girl is considered an essential
preliminary to the union. She gives it before a council of elders, and
if necessary is allowed time to make up her mind. The boy must also
agree to the match. Elsewhere matches are arranged by the parents, and
a bride-price which amounts to a fairly substantial sum in comparison
with the means of the parties is usually paid. But still the girls have
a considerable amount of freedom. It is generally considered that if a
girl goes of her own accord and pours turmeric and water over a man, it
is a valid marriage and he can take her to live in his house. Married
women also sometimes do this to another man if they wish to leave their
husbands.</p>

<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e4054">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">18. The marriage ceremony.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most distinctive feature of a Gond marriage is
that the procession usually starts from the bride&rsquo;s house and the
wedding is held at that of the bridegroom, in contradistinction to the
Hindu practice. It is supposed that this is a survival of the custom of
marriage by capture, when the bride was carried off from her own house
to the bridegroom&rsquo;s, and any ceremony which was requisite was
necessarily held at the house of the latter. But the Gonds say that
since D&#363;lha Deo, the bridegroom god and one of the commonest
village deities, was carried off by a tiger on his way to his wedding,
it was decided that in future the bride must go to the bridegroom to be
married in order to obviate the recurrence of such a calamity. Any risk
incidental to the journey thus falls to the lady. Among the wilder
M&#257;ria Gonds of Bastar the ritual is very simple. The bride&rsquo;s
party arrive at the bridegroom&rsquo;s village and occupy some huts
made ready for them. His father sends them provisions, including a pig
and fowls, and the day passes in feasting. In the evening they go to
the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, and the night is spent in dancing by the
couple and the young people of the village. Next morning the
bride&rsquo;s people go back again, and after another meal her parents
bring her to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house and push her inside, asking
the boy&rsquo;s father to take charge of her, and telling her that she
now belongs to her husband&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74"
href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>family and must not come back to
them alone. The girl cries a little for form&rsquo;s sake and
acquiesces, and the business is over, no proper marriage rite being
apparently performed at all. Among the more civilised M&#257;rias the
couple are seated for the ceremony side by side under a green shed, and
water is poured on them through the shed in imitation of the
fertilising action of rain. Some elder of the village places his hands
on them and the wedding is over. But Hindu customs are gradually being
adopted, and the rubbing of powdered turmeric and water on the bodies
of the bride and bridegroom is generally essential to a proper wedding.
The following description is given of the Gonds of Kanker. On the day
fixed for the marriage the pair, accompanied by the Dosi or caste
priest, proceed to a river, in the bed of which two reeds five or six
feet high are placed just so far apart that a man can lie down between
them, and tied together with a thread at the top. The priest lies down
between the reeds, and the bride and bridegroom jump seven times over
his body. After the last jump they go a little way off, throw aside
their wet clothes, and then run naked to a place where their dry
clothes are kept; they put them on and go home without looking back.
Among the Gonds in Khair&#257;garh the pair are placed in two pans of a
balance and covered with blankets. The caste priest lifts up the
bridegroom&rsquo;s pan and her female relatives the bride&rsquo;s, and
walk round with them seven times, touching the marriage-post at each
time. After this they are taken outside the village without being
allowed to see each other. They are placed standing at a little
distance with a screen between them, and liquor is spilt on the ground
to make a line from one to the other. After a time the bridegroom lifts
up the screen, rushes on the bride, gives her a blow on the back and
puts the ring on her finger, at the same time making a noise in
imitation of the cry of a goat. All the village then indulge in
bacchanalian orgies, not sparing their own relations.</p>

<h4 class="main">19. Wedding expenditure.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Bastar it is said that the expenses of a wedding
vary from Rs. 5 to Rs. 20 for the bride&rsquo;s family and from Rs. 10
to Rs. 50 for the bridegroom&rsquo;s, according to their
means.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4066src" href="#xd21e4066" name=
"xd21e4066src">25</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75"
name="pb75">75</a>]</span>In a fairly well-to-do family the expenditure
of the bridegroom&rsquo;s family is listed as follows: liquor Rs. 20,
rice Rs. 12, salt Rs. 2, two goats Rs. 2, chillies Rs. 2,
<i>gh&#299;</i> Rs. 4, turmeric Rs. 2, oil Rs. 3, three cloths for the
bride Rs. 8, two sheets and a loin-cloth for her relatives Rs. 5,
payment to the Kumh&#257;r for earthen pots Rs. 5, the bride-price Rs.
10, present to the bride&rsquo;s maternal uncle when she is not married
to his son Rs. 2, and something for the drummers. The total of this is
Rs. 76, and any expenditure on ornaments which the family can afford
may be added. In wealthier localities the bride-price is Rs. 15 to 20
or more. Sometimes if the girl has been married and dies before the
bride-price has been paid, her father will not allow her body to be
buried until it is paid. The sum expended on a wedding probably
represents the whole income of the family for at least six months, and
often for a considerably longer period. In Ch&#257;nda<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4074src" href="#xd21e4074" name=
"xd21e4074src">26</a> the bride&rsquo;s party on arrival at the
bridegroom&rsquo;s village receive the <i>Bara jawa</i> or marriage
greeting, every one present being served with a little rice-water, an
onion and a piece of tobacco. At the wedding the bridegroom has a ring
either of gold, silver or copper, lead not being permissible, and
places this on the bride&rsquo;s finger. Often the bride resists and
the bridegroom has to force her fist open, or he plants his foot on
hers in order to control her while he gets the ring on to her finger.
Elsewhere the couple hold each other by the little fingers in walking
round the marriage-post, and then each places an iron ring on the
other&rsquo;s little finger. The couple then tie strings, coloured
yellow with turmeric, round each other&rsquo;s right wrists. On the
second day they are purified with water and put on new clothes. On the
third day they go to worship the god, preceded by two men who carry a
chicken in a basket. This chicken is called the Dhendha or associate of
the bridal couple, and corresponds to the child which in Hindu
marriages is appointed as the associate of the bridegroom. Just before
their arrival at the temple the village jester snatches away the
chicken, and pretends to eat it. At the temple they worship the god,
and deposit before him the strings coloured with turmeric which had
been tied on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>their wrists. In Chhindw&#257;ra the bride is
taken on a bullock to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house. At the wedding four
people hold out a blanket in which ju&#257;ri, lemons and eggs are
placed, and the couple walk round this seven times, as in the Hindu
<i>bh&#257;nwar</i> ceremony. They then go inside the house, where a
chicken is torn asunder and the blood sprinkled on their heads. At the
same time the bride crushes a chicken under her foot. In Mandla the
bride on entering the marriage-shed kills a chicken by cutting off its
head either with an axe or a knife. Then all the gods of her house
enter into her and she is possessed by them, and for each one she kills
a chicken, cutting off its head in the same manner. The chickens are
eaten by all the members of the bride&rsquo;s party who have come with
her, but none belonging to the bridegroom&rsquo;s party may partake of
them. Here the marriage-post is made of the wood of the mahua tree,
round which a <i>toran</i> or string of mango leaves is twisted, and
the couple walk seven times round this. In Wardha the bride and
bridegroom stand on the heap of refuse behind the house and their heads
are knocked together. In Bhand&#257;ra two spears are placed on the
heap of refuse and their ends are tied together at the top with the
entrails of a fowl. The bride and bridegroom have to stand under the
spears while water is poured over them, and then run out. Before the
bride starts the bridegroom must give her a blow on the back, and if he
can do this before she runs out from the spears it is thought that the
marriage will be lucky. The women of the bride&rsquo;s and
bridegroom&rsquo;s party also stand one at each end of a rope and have
a competition in singing. They sing against each other and see which
can go on the longest. Br&#257;hmans are not employed at a Gond
wedding. The man who officiates is known as Dosi, and is the
bridegroom&rsquo;s brother-in-law, father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s
husband or some similar relative. A woman relative of the bride helps
her to perform her part and is known as Saw&#257;sin. To the Dosi and
Saw&#257;sin the bride and bridegroom&rsquo;s parties present an
earthen vessel full of kodon. The donors mark the pots, take them home
and sow them in their own fields, and then give the crop to the Dosi
and Saw&#257;sin.</p>

<h4 class="main">20. Special customs.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some years ago in B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t the bride
and bridegroom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>sat and ate food together out of two leaf-plates.
When they had finished the bride took the leaf-plates, ran with them to
the marriage-shed, and fixed them in the woodwork so that they did not
fall down. The bridegroom ran after her, and if she did not put the
plates away quickly, gave her one or two blows with his fist. This
apparently was a symbolical training of the bride to be diligent and
careful in her household work. Among the R&#257;j-Gonds of Saugor, if
the bridegroom could not come himself he was accustomed to send his
sword to represent him. The Saw&#257;sin carried the sword seven times
round the marriage-post with the bride and placed a garland on her on
its behalf, and the bride put a garland over the sword. This was held
to be a valid marriage. In a rich R&#257;j-Gond or Khatola Gond family
two or three girls would be given with the bride, and they would
accompany her and become the concubines of the bridegroom. Among the
M&#257;ria Gonds of Ch&#257;nda the wedded pair retire after the
ceremony to a house allotted to them and spend the night together.
Their relatives and friends before leaving shout and make merry round
the house for a time, and throw all kinds of rubbish and dirt on it. In
the morning the couple have to get up early and clear all this off, and
clean up the house. A curious ceremony is reported from one part of
Mandla. When a Gond girl is leaving to be married, her father places
inside her litter a necklace of many strings of blue and yellow beads,
with a number of cowries at the end, and an iron ring attached to it.
On her arrival at the bridegroom&rsquo;s house his father takes out the
necklace and ring. Sometimes it is said that he simply passes a stone
through the ring, but often he hangs it up in the centre of a room, and
the bridegroom&rsquo;s relatives throw stones at it until one of them
goes through the ring, or they throw long bamboo sticks or shoot arrows
at it, or even fire bullets from a gun. In a recent case it is said
that a man was trying to fire a bullet through the ring and killed a
girl. Until a stone, stick, arrow or bullet has been sent through the
ring the marriage cannot take place, nor can the bridegroom or his
father touch the bride, and they go on doing this all night until
somebody succeeds. When the feat has been done they pour a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>bottle
of liquor over the necklace and ring, and the bride&rsquo;s relatives
catch the liquor as it falls, and drink it. The girl wears the necklace
at her wedding, and thereafter so long as her husband lives, and when
he dies she tears the string to pieces and throws it into the river.
The iron ring must be made by a Gondi Loh&#257;r or blacksmith, and he
will not accept money in payment for it, but must be given a cow, calf,
or buffalo. The symbolical meaning of this rite does not appear to
require explanation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4098src" href=
"#xd21e4098" name="xd21e4098src">27</a> In many places the bride and
bridegroom go and bathe in a river or tank on the day after the
wedding, and throw mud and dirt over each other, or each throws the
other down and rolls him or her in the mud. This is called
Chikhal-Mundi or playing in the mud. Afterwards the bride has to wash
the bridegroom&rsquo;s muddy clothes, roll them up in a blanket, and
carry them on her head to the house. A see-saw is then placed in the
marriage-shed, and the bridegroom&rsquo;s father sits on it. The bride
makes the see-saw move up and down, while her relations joke with her
and say, &lsquo;Your child is crying.&rsquo; Elsewhere the
bridegroom&rsquo;s father sits in a swing. The bride and bridegroom
swing him, and the bystanders exclaim that the old man is the child of
the new bride. It seems possible that both customs are meant to portray
the rocking of a baby in a cradle or swinging it in a swing, and hence
it is thought that through performing them the bride will soon rock or
swing a real baby.</p>

<h4 class="main">21. Taking omens.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Bastar an omen is taken before the wedding. The
village elders meet on an auspicious day as Monday, Thursday or Friday,
and after midnight they cook and eat food, and go out into the forest.
They look for a small black bird called Usi, from which omens are
commonly taken. When anybody sees this bird, if it cries &lsquo;<i>Sun,
Sun</i>,&rsquo; on the right hand, it is thought that the marriage will
be lucky. If, however, it cries &lsquo;<i>Chi, Chi</i>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<i>Fie, Fie</i>,&rsquo; the proposed match is held to be of evil
omen, and is cancelled. The Koya Gonds of Bastar distil mahua liquor
before arranging for a match. If the liquor is good they think the
marriage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>will be lucky, and take the liquor with them to
cement the betrothal; but if it is bad they think the marriage will be
unlucky, and the proposal is dropped. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
are held to be lucky days for marriages, and they are celebrated in the
hot-weather months of Bais&#257;kh, Jesth and As&#257;r, or April, May
and June, or in P&#363;s (December), and rarely in M&#257;gh (January).
A wedding is only held in K&#257;rtik (October) if the bride and
bridegroom have already had sexual intercourse, and cannot take place
in the rains.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">22. Marriage by capture. Weeping and hiding.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Survivals of the custom of marriage by capture are to
be found in many localities. In Bastar the prospective bridegroom
collects a party of his friends and lies in wait for the girl, and they
catch her when she comes out and gets a little distance from her house.
The girl cries out, and women of the village come and rescue her and
beat the boys with sticks till they have crossed the boundary of the
village. The boys neither resist nor retaliate on the women, but simply
make off with the girl. When they get home a new cloth is given to her,
and the boys have a carouse on rice-beer, and the marriage is
considered to be complete. The parents do not interfere, but as a rule
the affair is prearranged between the girl and her suitor, and if she
really objects to the match they let her go. A similar procedure occurs
in Ch&#257;nda. Other customs which seem to preserve the idea that
marriage was once a forcible abduction are those of the bride weeping
and hiding, which are found in most Districts. In
B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t the bride and one or two friends go round to
the houses of the village and to other villages, all of them crying,
and receive presents from their friends. In Wardha the bride is
expected to cry continuously for a day and a night before the wedding,
to show her unwillingness to leave her family. In Kanker it is said
that before marriage the bride is taught to weep in different notes, so
that when that part of the ceremony arrives in which weeping is
required, she may have the proper note at her command. In
Chhindw&#257;ra the bridegroom&rsquo;s party go and fetch the bride for
the wedding, and on the night before her departure she hides herself in
some house in the village. The bridegroom&rsquo;s brother and other men
seek all through <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>the village for her, and when they find her she
runs and clings to the post of the house. The bridegroom&rsquo;s
brother carries her off by force, and she is taken on a bullock to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house. In Seoni the girl hides in the same manner,
and calls out &lsquo;Coo, coo,&rsquo; when they are looking for her.
After she is found, the bridegroom&rsquo;s brother carries her round on
his back to the houses of his friends in the village, and she weeps at
each house. When the bride&rsquo;s party arrive at the
bridegroom&rsquo;s village the latter&rsquo;s party meet them and stop
them from proceeding further. After waving sticks against each other in
a threatening manner they fall on each other&rsquo;s necks and weep.
Then two spears are planted to make an arch before the door, and the
bridegroom pushes the bride through these from behind, hitting her to
make her go through, while she hangs back and feigns reluctance. In
Mandla the bride sometimes rides to the wedding on the shoulders of her
sister&rsquo;s husband, and it is supposed that she never gets down all
the way.</p>

<h4 class="main">23. Serving for a wife.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The practice of Lamsena, or serving for a wife, is
commonly adopted by boys who cannot afford to buy one. The bridegroom
serves his prospective father-in-law for an agreed period, usually
three to five or even six years, and at its expiry he should be married
to the girl without expense. During this time he is not supposed to
have access to the girl, but frequently they become intimate, and if
this happens the boy may either stay and serve his unexpired term or
take his wife away at once; in the latter case his parents should pay
the girl&rsquo;s father Rs. 5 for each year of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
unexpired service. The Lamsena custom does not work well as a rule,
since the girl&rsquo;s parents can break their contract, and the
Lamsena has no means of redress. Sometimes if they are offered a good
bride-price they will marry the girl to another suitor when he has
served the greater part of his term, and all his work goes for
nothing.</p>

<h4 class="main">24. Widow remarriage.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The remarriage of widows is freely permitted. As a
rule it is considered suitable that she should marry her deceased
husband&rsquo;s younger brother, but she may not marry his elder
brother, and in the south of Bastar and Ch&#257;nda <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>the
union with the younger brother is also prohibited. In Mandla, if she
will not wed the younger brother, on the eleventh day after the
husband&rsquo;s death he puts the <i>tarkhi</i> or palm-leaf earrings
in her ears, and states that if she marries anybody else he will claim
<i>dawa-bunda</i> or compensation. Similarly in Bastar, if an outsider
marries the widow, he first goes through a joint ceremony with the
younger brother, by which the latter relinquishes his right in favour
of the former. The widow must not marry any man whom she could not have
taken as her first husband. After her husband&rsquo;s death she resides
with her parents, and a price is usually paid to them by any outsider
who wishes to marry her. In Bastar there is a fixed sum of Rs. 24, half
of which goes to the first husband&rsquo;s family and half to the caste
<i>panch&#257;yat</i>. The payment to the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> perhaps
comes down from the period when widows were considered the property of
the state or the king, and sold by auction for the benefit of the
treasury. It is said that the descendants of the Gond R&#257;jas of
Ch&#257;nda still receive a fee of Rs. 1&ndash;8 from every Gond widow
who is remarried in the territories over which their jurisdiction
extended. In Bastar when a widow marries again she has to be
transferred from the gods of her first husband&rsquo;s sept to those of
her second husband. For this two leaf-cups are filled with water and
mahua liquor respectively, and placed with a knife between them. The
liquor and water are each poured three times from one cup to the other
and back until they are thoroughly mixed, and the mixture is then
poured over the heads of the widow and her second husband. This
symbolises her transfer to the god of the new sept. In parts of Bastar
when a man has been killed by a tiger and his widow marries again, she
goes through the ceremony not with her new husband but with a lance,
axe or sword, or with a dog. It is thought that the tiger into which
her first husband&rsquo;s spirit has entered will try to kill her
second husband, but owing to the precaution taken he will either simply
carry off the dog or will himself get killed by an axe, sword or lance.
In most localities the ceremony of widow-marriage is simple. Turmeric
is rubbed on the bodies of the couple and they may exchange a pair of
rings or their clothes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href=

<h4 class="main">25. Divorce.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Divorce is freely allowed on various grounds, as for
adultery on the wife&rsquo;s part, a quarrelsome disposition,
carelessness in the management of household affairs, or if a
woman&rsquo;s children continue to die, or she is suspected of being a
witch. Divorce is, however, very rare, for in order to get a fresh wife
the man would have to pay for another wedding, which few Gonds can
afford, and he would also have difficulty in getting a girl to marry
him. Therefore he will often overlook even adultery, though a
wife&rsquo;s adultery not infrequently leads to murder among the Gonds.
In order to divorce his wife the husband sends for a few castemen,
takes a piece of straw, spits on it, breaks it in two and throws it
away, saying that he has renounced all further connection with his
wife. If a woman is suspected of being a witch she often has to leave
the village and go to some place where she is not known, and in that
case her husband must either divorce her or go with her. There is no
regular procedure for a wife divorcing her husband, but she can, if
sufficiently young and attractive, take matters into her own hands, and
simply leave her husband&rsquo;s house and go and live with some one
else. In such a case the man who takes her has to repay to the husband
the sum expended by the latter on his marriage, and the
<i>panch&#257;yat</i> may even decree that he should pay double the
amount. When a man divorces his wife he has no liability for her
maintenance, and often takes back any ornaments he may have given her.
And a man who marries a divorced woman may be expected to pay her
husband the expenses of his marriage. Instances are known of a bride
disappearing even during the wedding, if she dislikes her partner; and
Mr. Lampard of the Baihir Mission states that one night a Gond wedding
party came to his house and asked for the loan of a lantern to look for
the bride who had vanished.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Polygamy is freely allowed, and the few Gonds who can
afford the expense are fond of taking a number of wives. Wives are very
useful for cultivation as they work better than hired servants, and to
have several wives is a sign of wealth and dignity. A man who has a
number of wives will take them all to the baz&#257;r in a body to
display his importance. A Gond who had seven wives in
B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=

<h4 class="main">27. Menstruation.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In parts of Mandla the first appearance of the signs
of puberty in a girl is an important occasion. She stays apart for four
days, and during this time she ties up one of her body-cloths to a beam
in the house in the shape of a cradle, and swings it for a quarter or
half an hour every day in the name of Jhul&#257;n Devi, the cradle
goddess. On the fifth day she goes and bathes, and the Baiga priest and
his wife go with her. She gives the Baiga a hen and five eggs and a
bottle of wine, and he offers them to Jhul&#257;n Devi at her shrine.
To the Baigan she gives a hen and ten eggs and a bottle of liquor, and
the Baigan tattoos the image of Jhul&#257;n Devi on each side of her
body. A black hen with feathers spotted with white is usually chosen,
as they say that this hen&rsquo;s blood is of a darker colour and that
she lays more eggs. All this ceremonial is clearly meant to induce
fertility in the girl. The Gonds regard a woman as impure for as long
as the menstrual period lasts, and during this time she cannot draw
water nor cook food, nor go into a cowshed or touch cowdung. In the
wilder M&#257;ria tracts there is, or was till lately, a building out
of sight of the village to which women in this condition retired. Her
relatives brought her food and deposited it outside the hut, and when
they had gone away she came out and took it. It was considered that a
great evil would befall any one who looked on the face of a woman
during the period of this impurity. The R&#257;j-Gonds have the same
rules as Hindus regarding the menstrual periods of women.<a class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No special rites are observed during pregnancy, and
the superstitions about women in this condition resemble those of the
Hindus.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4191src" href="#xd21e4191" name=
"xd21e4191src">29</a> A pregnant woman must not go near a horse or
elephant, as they think that either of these animals would be excited
by her condition and would assault her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>In cases where labour is
prolonged they give the woman water to drink from a swiftly flowing
stream, or they take pieces of wood from a tree struck by lightning or
by a thunder-bolt, and make a necklace of them and hang it round her
neck. In these instances the swiftness of the running water, or of the
lightning or thunder-bolt, is held to be communicated to the woman, and
thus she will obtain a quick delivery. Or else they ask the Gunia or
sorcerer to discover what ancestor will be reborn in the child, and
when he has done this he calls on the ancestor to come and be born
quickly. If a woman is childless they say that she should worship Bura
Deo and fast continually, and then on the termination of her monthly
impurity, after she has bathed, if she walks across the shadow of a man
she will have a child. It is thus supposed that the woman can be made
fertile by the man&rsquo;s shadow, which will be the father of the
child. Or she should go on a Sunday night naked to a <i>s&#257;j</i>
tree<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4199src" href="#xd21e4199" name=
"xd21e4199src">30</a> and pray to it, and she may have a child. The
<i>s&#257;j</i> is the tree in which Bura Deo resides, and was probably
in the beginning itself the god. Hence it is supposed that the woman is
impregnated by the spirit of the tree, as Hindu women think that they
can be made fertile by the spirits of unmarried Br&#257;hman boys
living in p&#299;pal trees. Or she may have recourse to the village
priest, the Bhumka or the Baiga, who probably finds that her barren
condition is the work of an evil spirit and propitiates him. If a woman
dies in the condition of pregnancy they cut her belly open before
burial, so that the spirit of the child may escape. If she dies during
or soon after delivery they bury her in some remote jungle spot, from
which her spirit will find it difficult to return to the village. The
spirit of such a woman is supposed to become a Churel and to entice
men, and especially drunken men, to injury by causing them to fall into
rivers or get shut up in hollow trees. The only way they can escape her
is to offer her the ornaments which a married woman wears. Her enmity
to men is due to the fact that she was cut off when she had just had
the supreme happiness of bearing a child, and the present of these
ornaments appeases her. The spirit of a woman whose engagement for
marriage has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>been broken off, or who has deserted her
husband&rsquo;s house for another man&rsquo;s, is also supposed to
become a Churel. If an abortion occurs, or a child is born dead or dies
very shortly after birth, they put the body in an earthen pot, and bury
it under the heap of refuse behind the house. They say that this is
done to protect the body from the witches, who if they get hold of it
will raise the child&rsquo;s spirit, and make it a Bir or familiar
spirit. Witches have special power over the spirits of such children,
and can make them enter the body of an owl, a cat, a dog, or a headless
man, and in this form cause any injury which the witch may desire to
inflict on a human being. The real reason for burying the bodies of
such children close to the house is probably, however, the belief that
they will thus be born again in the same family. If the woman is fat
and well during pregnancy they think a girl will be born, but if she is
ailing and thin, that the child will be a boy. If the nipples of her
breasts are of a reddish colour they think the birth of a boy is
portended, but if of blackish colour, a girl. When a birth occurs
another woman carefully observes the knots or protuberances on the
navel-cord. It is supposed that the number of them indicates the
further number of children which will be born to the mother. A blackish
knot inclining downwards portends a boy, and a reddish one inclining
upwards a girl. It is supposed that an intelligent midwife can change
the order of these knots, and if a woman has only borne girl-children
can arrange that the next one shall be a boy.</p>

<h4 class="main">29. Procedure at a birth.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Professional midwives are not usually employed at
childbirth, and the women look after each other. Among the M&#257;ria
Gonds of Bastar the father is impure for a month after the birth of a
child and does not go to his work. A Muria Gond father is impure until
the navel-cord drops; he may reap his crop, but cannot thresh or sow.
This is perhaps a relic of the custom of the Couvade. The rules for the
treatment of the mother resemble those of the Hindus, but they do not
keep her so long without food. On some day from the fifth to the
twelfth after the birth the mother is purified and the child is named.
On this day its hair is shaved by the son-in-law or husband&rsquo;s or
wife&rsquo;s brother-in-law. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>The mother and child are washed and
rubbed with oil and turmeric, and the house is freshly whitewashed and
cleaned with cowdung. They procure a winnowing-fan full of kodon and
lay the child on it, and the mother ties this with a cloth under her
arm. In the N&#257;gpur country the impurity of the mother is said to
last for a month, during which time she is not allowed to cook food and
no one touches her. Among the poorer Gonds the mother often does not
lie up at all after a birth, but eats some pungent root as a tonic and
next day goes on with her work.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">30. Names.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the Sor night, or that of purification, the women
of the village assemble and sing. The mother holds the child in her
lap, and they each put a pice (&frac14;d.) in a dish as a present to
it. A name is chosen, and an elderly woman announces it. Names are now
often Hindu words, and are selected very much at random.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4221src" href="#xd21e4221" name=
"xd21e4221src">31</a> If the child was born on a Tuesday, Wednesday,
Friday or Sunday the name of the day is often given, as Mangal, Budhu,
Sukhiya, Itw&#257;ri; or if born in the month of M&#257;gh (January),
Ph&#257;gun (February), Chait (March), Bais&#257;kh (April), Jesth
(May), or P&#363;s (December), the name may be from the month, as
M&#257;hu, Ph&#257;gu, Chaitia, Bais&#257;khu, Jetha and Puso. The
names of the other months are also given, but are less common. If any
Government official is in the village when the child is born it may be
named after his office, as Daroga, Havildar (head-constable),
Vaccinator, Patw&#257;ri (village surveyor), Jemad&#257;r (head
process-server), or Munshi (clerk). If a European officer is in the
village the child may be called Gora (red) or Bhura (brown). Other
names are Zam&#299;nd&#257;r (landholder) or Kirs&#257;n (tenant). Or
the child may be named after any peculiarity, as Ghurman, fat, Kaluta,
black, Chatua, one who kicks, and so on. Or it may be given a bad name
in order to deceive the evil spirits as to its value, as Ghurha, a heap
of cowdung, Jh&#257;ru, sweepings, Dumre or Bhangi, a sweeper, Chamari,
a Cham&#257;r or tanner, and so on. If the mother has got the child
after propitiating a spirit, it may be called Bh&#363;ta, from
<i>bh&#363;t</i>, a spirit or ghost. Nicknames are also given to people
when they grow up, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87"
name="pb87">87</a>]</span>Dariya, long-footed, Bobdi, fat and sluggish,
Putchi, having a tail or cat-like, Bera, an idiot, and so on. Such
names come into general use, and the bearers accept and answer to them
without objection. All the above names are Hindi. Names taken from the
Gond language are rare or non-existent, and it would appear either that
they have been completely forgotten, or else that the Gonds had not
advanced to the stage of giving every individual a personal name prior
to their contact with the Hindus.</p>

<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e4229">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">31. Superstitions about children.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If a child is born feet first its feet are supposed to
have special power, and people suffering from pain in the back come and
have their backs touched by the toes of the child&rsquo;s left foot.
This power is believed to be retained in later life. If a woman gets a
child when the signs of menstruation have not appeared, the child is
called Lamka, and is held to be in danger of being struck by lightning.
In order to avert this fate an offering of a white cock is made to the
lightning during the month of As&#257;rh (June) following the birth,
when thunderstorms are frequent, and prayer is made that it will accept
this sacrifice in lieu of the life of the child. They think that the
ancestors who have been mingled with Bura Deo may be born again.
Sometimes such an ancestor appears in a dream and intimates that he is
coming back to earth. Then if a newborn child will not drink its
mother&rsquo;s milk, they think it is some important male ancestor, and
that he is vexed at being in such a dependent position to a woman over
whom he formerly had authority. So they call the Gunia or sorcerer, and
he guesses what ancestor has been reborn by measuring a stick. He says
that if the length of the stick is an even number of times the breadth
of his hand, or more or less than half a hand-breadth over, such and
such an ancestor is reborn in the child. Then he measures his hand
along the stick breadthwise, and when the measurement comes to that
foretold for a particular ancestor he says that this one has been
reborn; or if they find any mark on the body of the child corresponding
to one they remember to have been borne by a particular ancestor, they
identify it with this ancestor. Then they wash the child&rsquo;s feet
as a token of respect, and pass their hands over its head and say to
it, &lsquo;Drink milk, and we will give you a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>ring and
clothes and jewels.&rsquo; Sometimes they think that an ancestor has
been born again in a calf, and the Gunia ascertains who he is in the
same manner. Then this calf is not castrated if a bull, nor put to the
plough if it is a cow, and when it dies they will not take off its hide
for sale but bury it with the hide on.</p>
<p>It is believed that if a barren woman can get hold of the first hair
of another woman&rsquo;s child or its navel-cord, she can transfer the
mother&rsquo;s fertility to herself, so they dispose of these articles
very carefully. If they wish the child to grow fat, they bury the
navel-cord in a manure-heap. The upper milk teeth are thrown on to the
roof, and the lower ones buried under a water-pot. They say that the
upper ones should be in a high place, and the lower ones in a low
place. The teeth thrown on the roof may be meant for the rats, who in
exchange for them will give the child strong white teeth like their
own, while those thrown under the water-pot will cause the new teeth to
grow large and quickly, like the grass under a water-pot. Diseases of
children are attributed to evil spirits. The illness called Sukhi, in
which the body and limbs grow weak and have a dried-up appearance, is
very common, and is probably caused by malnutrition. They attribute it
to the machinations of an owl which has heard the child&rsquo;s name or
obtained a piece of its soiled clothing. If a stone or piece of wood is
thrown at the owl to scare it away, it will pick this up, and after
wetting it in a stream, put it out in the sun to dry. As the stone or
wood dries up, so will the child&rsquo;s body dry up and wither. In
order to cure this illness they use charms and amulets, and also let
the child wallow in a pig-sty so that it may become as fat as the pigs.
They say that they always beat a brass dish at a birth so that the
noise may penetrate the child&rsquo;s ears, and this will remove any
obstruction there may be to its hearing. If the child appears to be
deaf, they lay it several times in a deep grain-bin for about half an
hour at a time; when it cries the noise echoes in the bin, and this is
supposed to remove the obstruction to its power of hearing. If they
wish the boy to be a good dancer, they get a little of the flesh of the
kingfisher or hawk which hangs poised in the air over water by the
rapid vibration of its wings, on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>look-out for a fish, and
give him this to eat. If they wish him to speak well, they touch his
finger with the tip of a razor, and think that he will become talkative
like a barber. If they want him to run fast, they look for a stone on
which a hare has dropped some dung and rub this on his legs, or they
get a piece of a deer&rsquo;s horn and hang it round his neck as a
charm. If a girl or boy is very dark-coloured, they get the branches of
a creeper called <i>malkangni</i>, and express the oil from them, and
rub it on the child&rsquo;s face, and think it will make the face
reddish. Thus they apparently consider a black colour to be ugly.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Burial of the dead has probably been the general
custom of the Gonds in the past, and the introduction of cremation may
be ascribed to Hindu influence. The latter method of disposal involves
greater expense on account of the fuel, and is an honour reserved for
elders and important men, though in proportion as the body of the tribe
in any locality becomes well-to-do it may be more generally adopted.
The dead are usually buried with the feet pointing to the north in
opposition to the Hindu practice, and this fact has been adduced in
evidence of the Gond belief that their ancestors came from the north.
The M&#257;ria Gonds of Bastar, however, place the feet to the west in
the direction of the setting sun, and with the face upwards. In some
places the Hindu custom of placing the head to the north has been
adopted. Formerly it is said that the dead were buried in or near the
house in which they died, so that their spirits would thus the more
easily be born again in children, but this practice has now ceased. In
most British Districts Hindu ceremonial<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4256src" href="#xd21e4256" name="xd21e4256src">32</a> tends more
and more to be adopted, but in Bastar State and Ch&#257;nda some
interesting customs remain.</p>

<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e4259">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">33. Funeral ceremony.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the M&#257;ria Gonds a drum is beaten to
announce a death, and the news is sent to relatives and friends in
other villages. The funeral takes place on the second or third day,
when these have assembled. They bring some pieces of cloth, and these,
together with the deceased&rsquo;s own clothes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>and some
money, are buried with him, so that they may accompany his spirit to
the other world. Sometimes the women will put a ring of iron on the
body. The body is borne on a hurdle to the burial- or burning-ground,
which is invariably to the east of the village, followed by all the men
and women of the place. Arrived there, the bearers with the body on
their shoulders face round to the west, and about ten yards in front of
them are placed three <i>s&#257;j</i> leaves in a line with a space of
a yard between each, the first representing the supreme being, the
second disembodied spirits, and the third witchcraft. Sometimes a
little rice is put on the leaves. An axe is struck three times on the
ground, and a villager now cries to the corpse to disclose the cause of
his death, and immediately the bearers, impelled, as they believe, by
the dead man, carry the body to one of the leaves. If they halt before
the first, then the death was in the course of nature; if before the
second, it arose from the anger of offended spirits; if before the
third, witchcraft was the cause. The ordeal may be thrice repeated, the
arrangement of the leaves being changed each time. If witchcraft is
indicated as the cause of death, and confirmed by the repeated tests,
the corpse is asked to point out the sorcerer or witch, and the body is
carried along until it halts before some one in the crowd, who is at
once seized and disposed of as a witch. Sometimes the corpse may be
carried to the house of a witch in another village to a distance of
eight or ten miles. In Mandla in such cases a Gunia or exorciser
formerly called on the corpse to go forward and point out the witch.
The bearers then, impelled by the corpse, made one step forward and
stopped. The exorciser then again adjured the corpse, and they made a
step, and this was repeated again and again until they halted in front
of the supposed witch. All the beholders and the bearers themselves
thus thought that they were impelled by the corpse, and the episode is
a good illustration of the power of suggestion. Frequently the detected
witch was one of the deceased&rsquo;s wives. In Mandla the cause of the
man&rsquo;s death was determined in the digging of his grave. When
piling in the earth removed for the grave after burial, if it reached
exactly to the surface of the ground, they thought that the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>dead man had died after living the proper span of
his life. If the earth made a mound over the hole, they thought he had
lived beyond his allotted time and called him S&#299;gpur, that is a
term for a measure of grain heaped as high as it will stand above the
brim. But if the earth was insufficient and did not reach to the level
of the ground, they held that he had been prematurely cut off, and had
been killed by an enemy or by a witch through magic.</p>
<p>Children at breast are buried at the roots of a mahua tree, as it is
thought that they will suck liquor from them and be nourished as if by
their mother&rsquo;s milk. The mahua is the tree from whose flowers
spirits are distilled. The body of an adult may also be burnt under a
mahua tree so that the tree may give him a supply of liquor in the next
world. Sometimes the corpse is bathed in water, sprinkled over with
milk and then anointed with a mixture of mahua oil, turmeric and
charcoal, which will prevent it from being reincarnated in a human
body. In the case of a man killed by a tiger the body is burned, and a
bamboo image of a tiger is made and thrown outside the village. None
but the nearest relatives will touch the body of a man killed by a
tiger, and they only because they are obliged to do so. None of the
ornaments are removed from the corpse, and sometimes any other
ornaments possessed by the deceased are added to them, as it is thought
that otherwise the tiger into which his spirit passes will come back to
look for them and kill some other person in the house. In some
localities any one who touches the body of a man killed or even wounded
by a tiger or panther is put temporarily out of caste. Yet the Gonds
will eat the flesh of tigers and panthers, and also of animals killed
and partly devoured by them. When a man has been killed by a tiger, or
when he has died of disease and before death vermin have appeared in a
wound, the whole family are temporarily out of caste and have to be
purified by an elaborate ceremony in which the Bhumka or village priest
officiates. The method of laying the spirit of a man killed by a tiger
resembles that described in the article on Baiga.</p>

<h4 class="main">34. Mourning and offerings to the dead.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mourning is usually observed for three days. The
mourners abstain from work and indulgence in luxuries, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>the
house is cleaned and washed. The Gonds often take food on the spot
after the burial or burning of a corpse and they usually drink liquor.
On the third day a feast is given. In Chhindw&#257;ra a bullock or cow
is slaughtered on the death of a male or female Gond respectively. They
tie it up by the horns to a tree so that its forelegs are in the air,
and a man slashes it across the head once or twice until it dies. The
head is buried under a platform outside the village in the name of the
deceased. Sometimes the spirit of the dead man is supposed to enter
into one of the persons present and inform the party how he died,
whether from witchcraft or by natural causes. He also points out the
place where the bullock&rsquo;s or cow&rsquo;s head is to be buried,
and here they make a platform to his spirit with a memorial stone. Red
lead is applied to the stone and the blood of a chicken poured over it,
and the party then consume the bodies of the cow and chicken. In Mandla
the mourners are shaved at the grave nine or ten days after the death
by the brother-in-law or son-in-law of the deceased, and they cook and
eat food there and drink liquor. Then they come home and put oil on the
head of the heir and tie a piece of new cloth round his head. They give
the dead man&rsquo;s clothes and also a cow or bullock to the
Pardh&#257;n priest, and offer a goat to the dead man, first feeding
the animal with rice, and saying to the dead man&rsquo;s spirit,
&lsquo;Your son- or brother-in-law has given you this.&rsquo; Sometimes
the rule is that the priest should receive all the ornaments worn on
the right side of a man or the left side of a woman, including those on
the head, arm and leg. If they give him a cow or bullock, they will
choose the one which goes last when the animals are let out to graze.
Then they cook and eat it in the compound. They have no regular
anniversary ceremonies, but on the new moon of Kunw&#257;r (September)
they will throw some rice and pulse in front of the house and pour
water on it in honour of the dead. The widow breaks her glass bangles
when the funeral takes place, and if she is willing she may be married
to the dead man&rsquo;s younger brother on the expiry of the period of
mourning.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Bastar, at some convenient time after the death, a
stone is set up in memory of any dead person who was an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>adult,
usually by the roadside. Families who have emigrated to other
localities often return to their parent village for setting up these
stones. The stones vary according to the importance of the deceased,
those for prominent men being sometimes as much as eight feet high. In
some places a small stone seat is made in front, and this is meant for
the deceased to sit on, the memorial stone being his house. After being
placed in position the stone is anointed with turmeric, curds,
<i>gh&#299;</i> and oil, and a cow or pig is offered to it. Afterwards
irregular offerings of liquor and tobacco are made to the dead man at
the stone by the family and also by strangers passing by. They believe
that the memorial stones sometimes grow and increase in size, and if
this happens they think that the dead man&rsquo;s family will become
extinct, as the stone and the family cannot continue to grow together.
Elsewhere a long heap of stones is made in honour of a dead man,
sometimes with a flat-topped post at the head. This is especially done
for men who have died from epidemic disease or by an accident, and
passers-by fling stones on the heap with the idea that the dead
man&rsquo;s spirit will thereby be kept down and prevented from
returning to trouble the living. In connection with the custom of
making a seat at the deceased&rsquo;s tomb for his spirit to sit upon,
Mr. A. K. Smith writes: &ldquo;It is well known to every Gond that
ghosts and devils cannot squat on the bare ground like human beings,
and must be given something to sit on. The white man who requires a
chair to sit on is thus plainly akin to the world of demons, so one of
the few effective ways of getting Gonds to open their mouths and talk
freely is to sit on the ground among them. Outside every Gond house is
placed a rough bench for the accommodation of any devils that may be
flitting about at night, so that they may not come indoors and trouble
the inmates.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If one or two persons die in a house in one year, the
family often leave it and make another house. On quitting the old house
they knock a hole in the back wall to go out, so as to avoid going out
by the front door. This is usually done when the deaths have been due
to an epidemic, and it is presumably supposed that the dead men&rsquo;s
spirits will haunt the house and cause others to die, from spite at
their own <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=

Gonds will also frequently abandon it, and make a new village on
another site.</p>

<h4 class="main">37. Bringing back the soul.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They believe that the spirits of ancestors are
reincarnated in children or in animals. Sometimes they make a mark with
soot or vermilion on the body of a dead man, and if some similar mark
is subsequently found on any newborn child it is held that the dead
man&rsquo;s spirit has been reborn in it. In Bastar, on some selected
day a short time after the death, they obtain two small baskets and set
them out at night, placing a chicken under one and some flour of wheat
or kutki under the other. The householder then says, &ldquo;I do the
work of those old men who died. O spirits, I offer a chicken to you
to-day; be true and I will perform your funeral rites to-morrow.&rdquo;
On the next morning the basket placed over the flour is lifted up, and
if a mark resembling a footprint of a man or any animal be found, they
think that the deceased has become incarnate in a human being or in
that animal. Subsequently they sacrifice a cow to the spirit as
described. In other places on the fifth day after death they perform
the ceremony of bringing back the soul. The relatives go to the
riverside and call aloud the name of the dead person, and then enter
the river, catch a fish or insect and, taking it home, place it among
the sainted dead of the family, believing that the spirit of the dead
person has in this manner been brought back to the house. The
brother-in-law or son-in-law of the dead man will make a miniature
grass hut in the compound and place the fish or insect inside it. He
will then sacrifice a pig, killing it with a rice-husker, and with not
more than three blows. The animal is eaten, and next morning he breaks
down the hut and throws away the earthen pots from the house. They will
spread some flour on the ground and in the morning bring a chicken up
to it. If the animal eats the flour they say that the soul of the
deceased has shown his wish to remain in the house, and he is enshrined
there in the shape of a stone or copper coin. If it does not eat, then
they say that the spirit will not remain in the house. They take the
stone or coin outside the village, sacrifice a chicken to it and bury
it under a heap of stones to prevent it from returning. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>Sometimes at the funeral ceremony one of the party
is possessed by the spirit of the dead man, and a little white mark or
a small caterpillar appears on his hand, and they say that it is the
soul of the dead man come back. Then the caterpillar vanishes again,
and they say that the dead man has been taken among the gods, and go
home. Occasionally some mark may appear on the hand of the dead
man&rsquo;s son after a period of time, and he says that his
father&rsquo;s soul has come back, and gives another funeral feast. The
good souls are quickly appeased and their veneration is confined to
their descendants. But the bad ones excite a wider interest because
their evil influences may be extended to others. And the same fear
attaches to the spirits of persons who have died a violent or unnatural
death. The soul of a man who has been eaten by a tiger must be
specially propitiated, and ten or twelve days are occupied in bringing
it back. To ascertain when this has been done a thread is tied to a
beam and a copper ring is suspended from it, being secured by twisting
the thread round it and not by a knot. A pot full of water is placed
below the ring. Songs are then sung in propitiation and a watch is kept
day and night. When the ring falls from the thread and drops into the
water it is considered that the soul has come back. If the ring delays
to fall they adjure the dead man to come back and ask where he has gone
to and why he is tarrying. Animals are offered to the ring and their
blood poured over it, and when it finally falls they rejoice greatly
and say that the dead man has come back. The ancestors are represented
by small pebbles kept in a basket in the kitchen, which is considered
the holiest part of the house, or they may be pice copper coins
(&frac14;d.) tied up in a little bundle. They are daubed with vermilion
and worshipped occasionally. A man who has been killed by a tiger or
cobra may receive general veneration, with the object of appeasing his
spirit, and become a village god. And the same honour may be accorded
to any prominent man, such as the founder of a village.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Mandla the dead are sometimes mingled with Bura Deo
or the Great God. On the occasion of a communal sacrifice to Bura Deo a
stalk of <i>charra</i> grass is picked in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

dead ancestors, and tied to the little bundle containing a pice and a
piece of turmeric, which represents the dead ancestor in the house. The
stalk of grass and the bundle is called <i>kunda</i>; and all the
<i>kundas</i> are then hidden in grass or under stones in the adjacent
forest. Then Bura Deo comes on some man and possesses him, and he waves
his arms about and goes and finds all the <i>kundas</i>. Some of them
he throws down beside Bura Deo, and these they say have been absorbed
in Bura Deo and are disposed of. Others he throws apart, and these are
said not to have been absorbed into the god. For the latter, as well as
for all persons who have died a violent death, a heap of stones should
be made outside the village, and wine and a fowl are offered at the
heap, and passers-by cast additional stones on it to keep down their
spirits, which remain unquiet because they have not been absorbed in
the god, and are apt to wander about and trouble the living.</p>

<h4 class="main">39. Belief in a future life.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gonds seem originally to have had no idea of a
place of abode for the spirits of the dead, that is a heaven or hell.
So far as can be conjectured, their primary view of the fate of the
spirits of the dead, after they had come to consider the soul or spirit
as surviving the death of the body, was that they hung about the houses
and village where they had dwelt, and were able to exert considerable
influence on the lives and fortunes of their successors. An alternative
or subsequent view was that they were reincarnated, most frequently in
the bodies of children born in the same family, and less frequently in
animals. Whether or no this doctrine of reincarnation is comparatively
late and borrowed from Hinduism cannot be decided. In Bastar, however,
they have now a conception of retribution after death for the souls of
evil-doers. They say that the souls are judged after death, and the
sinful are hurled down into a dense forest without any <i>sulphi</i>
trees. The <i>sulphi</i> tree appears to be that variety of palm from
which palm-liquor or toddy is obtained in Bastar, and the Gond idea of
a place of punishment for departed sinners is, therefore, one in which
no alcoholic liquor is to be had. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97"

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">40. Nature of the Gond religion. The gods.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The religious practices of the Gonds present much
variety. The tribal divisions into groups worshipping seven, six, five
and four gods, already referred to, are generally held to refer to the
number of gods which a man has in his house. But very few Gonds can
name the gods of their sect, and the prescribed numbers are seldom
adhered to. The worship of ancestors is an integral part of their
religion and is described in the section on funeral customs. Bura Deo,
their great god in most localities, was probably at first the
<i>s&#257;j</i> tree,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4352src" href=
"#xd21e4352" name="xd21e4352src">33</a> but afterwards the whole
collection of gods were sometimes called Bura Deo. He is further
discussed subsequently. The other Gond gods proper appear to be
principally implements and weapons of the chase, one or two animals,
and deified human beings. A number of Hindu deities have now also been
admitted into the Gond pantheon. The following account of the gods is
largely taken from a note written by Mr. J. A. Tawney.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4356src" href="#xd21e4356" name=
"xd21e4356src">34</a> The worship of the Gonds may be summarised as
that of the gods presiding over the village destinies, the crops, and
epidemic disease, the spirits of their forefathers and the weapons and
creatures of the chase. The village gods are generally common to the
Gonds and Hindus. They consist of stones, or mud platforms, placed at a
convenient distance from the village under the shade of some
appropriate tree, and often having a red or white flag, made of a piece
of cloth, tied to the end of a pole to indicate their position. The
principal village gods have been given in the article on Kurmi. Besides
these in Gond villages there is especially Bh&#299;msen, who is held to
be Bhima, one of the five P&#257;ndava brothers, and is the god of
strength. Ghor Deo<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4362src" href=
"#xd21e4362" name="xd21e4362src">35</a> is the horse god, and Holera,
who is represented by a wooden bullock&rsquo;s bell, is the god of
cattle. Ghansi&#257;m Deo is a god much worshipped in Mandla. He is
said to have been a prince who was killed by a tiger on his way to his
wedding like D&#363;lha Deo. In northern Bastar the Gonds worship the
spirit of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>Muhammadan doctor under the name of Doctor Deo. A
Gond of the place where the doctor died is occasionally possessed by
his spirit, and on such occasions he can talk fluent Urdu. This
man&rsquo;s duty is to keep off cholera, and when the epidemic breaks
out he is ordered by the R&#257;ja to drive it away. The local method
of averting cholera is to make a small litter covered with cloth, and
in it to place a brass or silver image of the cholera goddess, Marai
M&#257;ta. When the goddess is thus sent from one village to another it
is supposed that the epidemic is similarly transferred. The man
possessed by Doctor Deo has the power of preventing the approach of
this litter to villages in Bastar, and apparently also can drive away
the epidemic, though his method of doing this is not explained. The
dealings of the Gonds with the Government of India are mainly conducted
through chupr&#257;ssies or peons, who come to collect their revenue,
obtain supplies and so on. The peons have in the past been accustomed
to abuse their authority and practise numerous petty extortions, which
is a very easy business with the ignorant Gonds of the wilder tracts.
Regarding the peons as the visible emblem of authority, the Gonds, like
the Oraons, have similarly furnished the gods with a peon, who is
worshipped under the name of Kalha Deo with offerings of liquor and
fowls. Besides this if a tiger makes himself troublesome a stone is set
up in his honour and he receives a small offering; and if a platform
has been erected to the memory of the founder of the village he is
included with the others. The cholera and smallpox deities are
worshipped when an epidemic breaks out. The worship of the village gods
is communal, and in Chh&#299;ndw&#257;ra is performed at the end of the
hot weather before seed is sown, houses thatched, or the new mahua oil
eaten by the Gonds. All the villagers subscribe, and the Bhumka or
village priest conducts the rite. If in any year the community cannot
afford a public worship they hang up a little grass over the god just
to intimate that they have not forgotten him, but that he will have to
wait till next year.</p>

<h4 class="main">41. Tribal gods, and their place of residence.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Besides the village gods worshipped in common with the
Hindus, the Gonds have also their special tribal gods. These are
sometimes kept at a Deo-khulla, which is said to mean <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>literally the threshing-floor of the gods, and is
perhaps so called because the place of meeting of the worshippers is
cleaned and plastered like a threshing-floor in the fields. The gods
most commonly found are Pharsi Pen, the battle-axe god; Matiya, the
great god of mischief; Ghangra, the bell god; Ch&#257;war, the
cow&rsquo;s tail, which is also used as a whisk; P&#257;lo, who
consists of a piece of cloth used to cover spear-heads; and Sale, who
may be the god who presides over cattle-pens (<i>s&#257;la</i>). The
Deo-khulla of a six-god Gond should have six, and that of a seven-god
Gond seven gods, but this rule is not regularly observed, and the
Deo-khullas themselves now tend to disappear as the Gonds become
Hinduised and attention is concentrated on the village and household
gods. The collection of gods at a Deo-khulla, Mr. Tawney remarks, is
called Bura Deo, and when a Gond swears by Bura Deo, he swears by all
the gods of his sect. &ldquo;The gods,&rdquo; Mr. Tawney writes,
&ldquo;are generally tied up in grass and fixed in the fork of the
s&#257;j tree, or buried in some recess in the forest, except
P&#257;lo, who is put in a bag to prevent his getting wet, and
Ch&#257;war the cow&rsquo;s tail. The Bhumkas or priests are somewhat
shy of showing the gods at the Deo-khulla, and they may have some
reason for this, for not long since, a young scamp of a Muhammadan,
having determined to put to a test the reputed powers of the Gond gods
for evil, hid himself in a tree near the Deo-khulla during a meeting,
and afterwards took the gods out and threw them bag and baggage down a
well. However, when I went there, the Bhumka at Muj&#257;war after some
parley retired into the forest, and came out quite confidingly with an
armful of gods. The Deo-khulla gods are generally all of iron, and
those at Muj&#257;war were all spear-shaped except P&#257;lo, who is a
piece of cloth, and Ghangra, who is of bell-metal and in form like the
bells ordinarily put round the necks of bullocks. When a spear-head has
been lost, and another is not available, anything in the shape of a
pike or spear will do, and it does not appear to make any difference so
long as iron is the metal used. Women may not worship at the
Deo-khulla. It seems clear that the original gods were, with the
exception of Ghangra, hunting-weapons and representations of animals.
Ghangra may be venerated because of his association with bullocks
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>and also on account of the melodious sound made
by bullock-bells. Of all the gods the most remarkable probably is
P&#257;lo. He is made of cloth and acts as a covering for the
spear-heads at the time of worship. The one I saw was a small cloth,
about 30 by 18 inches, and in the form of a shield. He is a very
expensive god and costs from Rs. 50 to Rs. 80, his outside value
perhaps being Rs. 5. When a new one is required it has to be made by a
Katia or R&#257;j-Pardh&#257;n, who must live in a separate house and
not go near his own till its completion. He must also be naked while he
is working and may not eat, drink, smoke or perform natural functions
till he has finished for the day. While engaged on the cloth he is well
fed by the Gonds and supplied with fowls and spirits; it is not
surprising, therefore, that the god is never finished in six months,
though I would engage to make one in a week. The cloth is embroidered
with figures in coloured silk, with a stitch or two of red silk in each
animal, which will subsequently represent blood. The animals I saw
embroidered were a bullock, some sort of deer, a gouty-looking snake
with a body as thick as the elephant&rsquo;s, and the latter animal
barely distinguishable from it by having two legs and a trunk. When
ready the cloth P&#257;lo is taken to the Deo-khulla and a great
worship is held, during which blood is seen to flow from the figures on
the cloth and they are supposed to be endowed with life.&rdquo; The
animals embroidered on the cloth are probably those principally revered
by the Gonds, as the elephant, snake, deer and bullock, while the
worship of the cloth itself and the embroidery on it indicates that
they considered the arts of weaving and sewing as divinely revealed
accomplishments. And the fact that the other gods were made of iron
shows a similar reverence for this metal, which they perhaps first
discovered in India. At any rate the quarrying and refining of
indigenous iron-ore is at present carried out by the Agarias, a caste
derived from the Gonds. The spear-head shape of most of the gods and
that of P&#257;lo like a shield show their veneration for these weapons
of war, which are themselves sacred.</p>

<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e4381">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">42. Household gods.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;In almost every house,&rdquo; Mr. Tawney
states, &ldquo;there is also a set of gods for everyday use. They are
often the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>as the village gods or those of the Deo-khulla
and also include deified ancestors. These household gods have a
tendency to increase, as special occasions necessitate the creation of
a new god, and once he is enthroned in the house he never seems to
leave it of his own accord. Thus if a man is killed by a cobra; he or
the cobra becomes a household god and is worshipped for many
generations. If a set of gods does not work satisfactorily, they are
also, some or all of them, discarded and a new lot introduced. The form
of the gods varies considerably, the only constant thing about them
being the vermilion with which they are all daubed. They are sometimes
all earthen cones and vary from that to miniature wooden tables. I may
mention that it is somewhat difficult to get a Gond either to confess
that he has any household gods or to show them. The best way is to send
off the father of the family on some errand, and then to ask his
unsuspecting wife to bring out the gods. You generally get them on a
tray and some of the villagers will help her to name them.&rdquo; In
Mandla in every Gond&rsquo;s house there is a Deoth&#257;na or
god&rsquo;s place, where all the gods are kept. Those who have children
include Jhul&#257;n Devi, or the cradle goddess, among their household
deities. In the Deoth&#257;na there is always a vessel full of water
and a stick, and when a man comes in from outside he goes to this and
sprinkles a little water over his body to free himself from any
impurity he may have contracted abroad.</p>

month of the rains, which the Gonds consider the beginning of the year,
snakes frequently appear. In this month they try to kill a cobra, and
will then cut off the head and tail, and offer them to N&#257;g Deo,
inside the house, while they cook and eat the body. They think that the
eating of the snake&rsquo;s body will protect them from the effects of
eating any poisonous substance throughout the year.</p>

impatient and perform his worship. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

The pig is laid on its back over the threshold of the door and a number
of men press a heavy beam of wood on its body till it is crushed to
death. They cut off the tail and testicles and bury them near the
threshold. The body of the pig is washed in a hole dug in the yard, and
it is then cooked and eaten. They sing to the god, &ldquo;Eat,
N&#257;r&#257;yan Deo, eat this rice and meat, and protect us from all
tigers, snakes and bears in our houses; protect us from all illnesses

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">45. Bura Deo.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bura Deo, the great god of the Gonds, is sometimes, as
seen, a name for all the gods in the Deo-khulla. But he is usually
considered as a single god, and often consists of a number of brass or
iron balls suspended to a ring and hung on a <i>s&#257;j</i> tree.
Again, he may be represented by a few links of a roughly forged iron
chain also hung on the tree, and the divine power of the chain is shown
by the fact that it can move of itself, and occasionally descends to
rest on a stone under the tree or migrates to a neighbouring nullah
(stream). Nowadays in Mandla Bura Deo is found as an iron doll made by
a neighbouring blacksmith instead of a chain. It would appear, however,
that he was originally the <i>s&#257;j</i> tree (<i>Boswellia
serrata</i>), an important forest tree growing to a considerable
height, which is much revered by the Gonds. They do not cut this tree,
nor its branches, except for ceremonial purposes, and their most sacred
form of oath is to swear by the name of Bura Deo, holding a branch of
the <i>s&#257;j</i> tree above the head. If Bura Deo was first the
<i>s&#257;j</i> tree, then we may surmise that when the Gonds
discovered iron they held it more sacred than the tree because it was
more important, as the material from which their axes and spears were
made. And therefore Bura Deo became an iron chain hanging on the
<i>s&#257;j</i> tree. The axe is a Gond&rsquo;s most valuable
implement, as with it he cut down the forest to clear a space for his
shifting cultivation, and also provided himself with wood for hutting,
fuel and other purposes. The axe and spear were also his weapons of
war. Hence the discovery <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>of iron was an enormous step
forward in civilisation, and this may account for the reverence in
which it is held by the Gonds. The metamorphosis of Bura Deo from an
iron chain to an iron doll may perhaps be considered to mark the
arrival of the Gonds at the stage of religion when anthropomorphic gods
are worshipped. Bura Deo is sometimes represented with Mah&#257;deo or
Siva and P&#257;rvati, two of the greatest Hindu deities, in attendance
on him on each side. Communal sacrifices of pigs and also of goats are
made to him at intervals of one or two years; the animals are stretched
out on their backs and killed by driving a stake of <i>s&#257;j</i> or
<i>tendu</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4431src" href="#xd21e4431"
name="xd21e4431src">36</a> wood through the belly. Sometimes a goat is
dedicated to him a year beforehand, and allowed to wander loose in the
village in the name of Bura Deo, and given good food, and even called
by the name of the god. It would appear that the original sacrificial
animal was the pig, and the goat was afterwards added or substituted.
Bura Deo is also worshipped on special occasions, as when a man has got
vermin in a wound, or, as the people of the country say, when god has
remembered him. In this case the sufferer must pay all the expenses of
the ceremony which is necessary for his purification. The dead are also
mingled in Bura Deo, as described in the section on funeral rites. Bura
Deo is believed to protect the Gonds from wild animals; and if members
of a family meet a tiger, snake or other dangerous animal several times
within a fairly short period, they think that Bura Deo is displeased
with them and have a special sacrifice in his honour. Ordinarily when
the Panda or priest sacrifices an animal he severs its head with an axe
and holds the head over the image or symbol of the god to allow the
blood to drop on it. Before sacrificing a chicken he places some grain
before it and says, &lsquo;If I have committed no fault, eat,&rsquo;
and if the chicken does not eat of itself he usually forces it to pick
a grain. Then he says that the sacrifice is acceptable to the god.</p>

If a man is possessed by an evil spirit, they will take some coins,
silver for preference, and wave them round his head with a lamp, and
take them out and bury them in a waste place. They throw one or two
more rupees on the surface of the soil in which they have buried the
coins. Then they think the spirit will leave the sufferer, and if any
one picks up the coins on the surface of the ground the spirit will

take them, even though they may be valuable, from fear of being
possessed by the spirit. Occasionally a man of a treacherous
disposition may transfer an evil spirit, which is haunting him, with a
daughter in marriage. The husband&rsquo;s family suspect this if a
spirit begins to trouble them. A Vaddai or magician is called, and he
tries to transfer the spirit to a fowl or goat by giving the latter
some rice to eat. If the spirit then ceases troubling they conclude
that it was transferred by the bride&rsquo;s father, and go to him and
reproach him. If he admits that he had a spirit in his family which has
given no trouble lately, they ask him to take it back, even though he
may not have intended its transfer. The goat or fowl to which the
spirit was transferred is then sacrificed in its name and the meat is
eaten only by the father-in-law&rsquo;s family, to whom the spirit thus
returns. A miniature hut is built for the spirit in his yard, and a
pot, a lamp and a knife are placed in the hut for its use, and an
offering of a goat is made to the spirit occasionally at festivals.</p>
<p>In order to injure an enemy they will make an image of him in clay,
preferably taken from underneath his footprint, and carry it to the
cemetery. Here they offer red lead, red thread, bangles, and various
kinds of grain and pulse to the ghosts and say to them, &ldquo;Male and
female deities, old and newly buried, maimed and lame, spirits of the
wind, I pronounce this charm with your help.&rdquo; Then they pierce
the figure with arrows in the chest and cut it with a knife in the
region of the liver and think that their enemy will die. Another method
is to draw the likeness of an enemy on cloth with lime or charcoal, and
bury it in a pot in front of his house on a Sunday or Tuesday night
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>so that he may walk on it in the morning, when
they hope that the same result will be achieved.</p>
<p>In order to breed a quarrel in an enemy&rsquo;s house they get the
feathers of a crow, or the seeds of the <i>amalt&#257;s</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4451src" href="#xd21e4451" name=
"xd21e4451src">37</a> or porcupine needles, and after smoking them over
a fire in which some nails have been placed, tie them to the eaves of
his house, repeating some charm. The seeds of the <i>amalt&#257;s</i>
rattle in their pods in the wind, and hence it is supposed that they
will produce a noise of quarrelling. Porcupine&rsquo;s quills are sharp
and prickly, and crow&rsquo;s feathers are perhaps efficacious because
the crow is supposed to be a talkative and quarrelsome bird. The nails
in the fire, being sharp-pointed, may be meant to add potency to the
charm. One who wishes to transfer sickness to another person obtains a
cloth belonging to the latter and draws two human figures on it, one
right side up and the other upside down, in lamp-black. After saying
charms over the cloth he puts it back surreptitiously in the
owner&rsquo;s house. When people are ill they make a vow to some god
that if they recover they will sacrifice a certain number of animals
proportionate to the severity of the illness. If the patient then
recovers, and the vow is for a larger number of animals than he can
afford, he sets fire to a piece of forest so that a number of animals
may be burnt as an offering to the god, and his vow may thus be
fulfilled. This practice has no doubt gone out owing to the
conservation of forests.</p>

<p class="first">If a Gond, when starting on a journey in the morning,
should meet a tiger, cat, hare, or a four-horned deer, he will return
and postpone his journey; but if he meets one of these animals when he
is well on the way it is considered to be lucky. Rain falling at a
wedding or some other festival is believed to be unlucky, as it is as
if somebody were crying. In Mandla, if a cock crows in the night, a man
will get up at once, catch it and twist its neck, and throw it over the
house as far away as he can. Apparently the cock is supposed to be
calling to evil spirits. If a hen cackles, or lays eggs at night, it is
also considered inauspicious, and the bird is often killed or given
away. They think they can acquire strength by carrying the
shoulder-bones of a tiger <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href=
"#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>on their shoulders or drinking a
little of the bone-dust pounded in water. If there is disease in the
village, the Bhumka or village priest performs the ceremony of <i>Gaon
b&#257;ndhna</i> or tying up the village. Accompanied by a party of men
he drives a pig all round the village boundary, scattering grains of
urad pulse and mustard seed on the way. The pig is then sacrificed, its
blood is sprinkled on all the village gods, and it is eaten by the
party. No man or animal may go outside the village on the day of this
ceremony, which should be performed on a Sunday or Wednesday. When
cattle disease breaks out the Bhumka makes an arch of three poles, to
which is hung a string of mango leaves, and all the cattle of the
village are driven under it to avert the disease.</p>

<h4 class="main">48. Agricultural superstitions.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When there is drought two boys put a pestle across
their shoulders, tie a living frog to it with a rag, and go from house
to house accompanied by other boys and girls singing:</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e4473">
<p class="line">Mendak Bhai p&#257;ni de,</p>
<p class="line">Dh&#257;n, kodon pakne de,</p>
<p class="line">Mere by&#257;h hone de,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">or &lsquo;Brother Frog give rain; let the rice and
kodon ripen; let my marriage be held.&rsquo; The frog is considered to
be able to produce rain because it lives in water and therefore has
control over its element. The boy&rsquo;s point in asking the frog to
let his marriage be held is that if the rains failed and the crops
withered, his parents would be unable to afford the expense. Another
method of obtaining rain is for two naked women to go and harness
themselves to a plough at night, while a third naked woman drives the
plough and pricks them with a goad. This does not appear capable of
explanation on any magical basis, so far as I know, and the idea may
possibly be to force the clemency of the gods by showing their
extraordinary sufferings, or to show that the world is topsy-turvy for
want of rain. A leather rope is sometimes tied to a plough and harrow,
and the boys and girls pull against one another on the rope in a
tug-of-war. If the girls win they think that rain will soon come, but
if the boys win that it will not. In order to stop excessive rain, a
naked bachelor collects water from the eaves in a new earthen pot,
covers the pot with a lid or with mud, and buries <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>it
beneath the earth; or the pot may be filled with salt. Here it may
perhaps be supposed that, as the water dries up in the pot or the salt
gets dry, so the rain will stop and the world generally become dry. The
reason for employing women to produce rain, and men to stop it, may be
that women, as they give milk, will be more potent in obtaining the
other liquid, water. Nakedness is a common element in magic, perhaps
because clothes are considered a civilised appanage, and unsuitable for
a contest with the powers of nature; a certain idea of impurity may
also attach to them. If a crow in carrying a straw to build its nest
holds it in the middle, they think that the rains will be normal and
adequate; but if the straw is held towards one end, that the rains will
be excessive or deficient. If the <i>titahri</i> or sandpiper lays four
eggs properly arranged, they think that sufficient rain will fall in
all the four monsoon months. If only one, two or three eggs are laid,
or only this number properly placed in the nest and the others at the
side, then the rains will be good only in an equivalent number of
months.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the harvest they pluck an ear of corn and say,
&lsquo;Whatever god is the guardian of this place, this is your share,
take it, and do not interfere.&rsquo; The last plants in the field are
cut and sent home by a little girl and put at the bottom of the
grain-bin of the house. Chitkuar Devi is the goddess of the
threshing-floor, and before beginning to winnow the grain they
sacrifice a pig and a chicken to her, cutting the throats of the
animals and letting their blood drop on to the central post of the
threshing-floor. When they are about to take the kodon home, they set
aside a basketful and give it to the sister&rsquo;s son or
sister&rsquo;s husband of the owner, placing a bottle of liquor on the
top, and he takes it home to the house, and there they drink one or two
bottles of liquor, and then begin eating the new grain.</p>

<h4 class="main">49. Magical or religious observances in fishing and
hunting.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Mandla the Gonds still perform, or did till
recently, various magical or religious rites to obtain success in
fishing and hunting. The men of a village were accustomed to go out
fishing as a communal act. They arrived at the river before sunrise,
and at midday their women brought them <i>pej</i> or gruel. On
returning the women made a mound or platform before the house of the
principal man of the party. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>All the fish caught were
afterwards laid on this platform and the leader then divided them,
leaving one piece on the platform. Next morning this piece was taken
away and placed on the grave of the leader&rsquo;s ancestor. If no fish
were caught on the first day, then on the next day the women took the
men no food. And if they caught no fish for two or three days running,
they went and dug up the platform erected in front of the
leader&rsquo;s house and levelled it with the ground. Then the next
morning early all the people of the village went to another village and
danced the Sela dance before the tombs of the ancestors of that
village. Sometimes they went on to a third village and did the same.
The headman of the village visited levied a contribution from his
people, and gave them food and drink and a present of Rs. 1&ndash;4.
With this they bought liquor, and coming back to their own village,
offered it in front of the platform which they had levelled, and drank
it. Next morning they went fishing again, but said that they did not
care whether they caught anything or not, as they had pleased their
god. Next year all the people of the village they had visited would
come and dance the Sela dance at their village the whole day, and the
hosts had to give the visitors food and drink. This was said to be from
gratitude to the headman of the other village for placating their god
with an offering of Rs. 1&ndash;4. And the visit might even be repeated
annually so long as the headman of the other village was alive.
Apparently in this elaborate ritual the platform especially represented
the forefathers of the village, whose spirits were supposed to give
success in fishing. If the fishers were unsuccessful, they demolished
the platform to show their displeasure to the spirits, and went and
danced before the ancestors of another village to intimate the transfer
of their allegiance from their own ancestors to these latter. The
ancestors would thus feel themselves properly snubbed and discarded for
their ill-nature in not giving success to the fishing party. But when
they had been in this condition for a day or so the headman of the
other village sent them an offering of liquor, and it was thus
intimated to them that, though their own descendants had temporarily
transferred their devotion, they were not entirely abandoned. It would
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>be hoped that the ancestors would lay the lesson
to heart, and, placated by the liquor, be more careful in future of the
welfare of their descendants. The season for fishing was in Kunw&#257;r
and K&#257;rtik, and it sometimes extended into Aghan (September to
November). During these months, from the time the new kodon was cut at
the beginning of the period, they danced the Sela, and they did not
dance this dance at any other time of the year.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4501src" href="#xd21e4501" name="xd21e4501src">38</a> At other
seasons they would dance the Karma. The Sela dance is danced by men
alone; they have sticks and form two circles, and walk in and out in
opposite directions, beating their sticks together as they pass.
Sometimes other men sit on the shoulders of the dancers and beat their
sticks. Sela is said to be the name of the stick. In the Sela dance the
singing is in the form of Dadaria, that is, one party recites a line
and the other party replies; this is not done in the Karma dance, for
which they have regular songs. It seems possible that the Sela dance
was originally a mimic combat, danced before they went out to fight in
order to give them success in the battle. Subsequently it might be
danced before they went out hunting and fishing with the same object.
If there was no stream to which they could go fishing they would buy
some fish and offer it to the god, and have a holiday and eat it, or if
they could not go fishing they might go hunting in a party instead.
When a single Gond intends to go out hunting in the forest he first
lights a lamp before his household god in the house, or if he has no
oil he will kindle a fire, and the lamp or fire must be kept burning
all the time he is out. If he returns successful he offers a chicken to
the god and extinguishes the lamp. But if he is unsuccessful he keeps
the lamp burning all night, and goes out again early next morning. If
he gets more game this time he will offer the chicken, but if not he
will extinguish the lamp, put his gun outside and not touch it again
for eight days. A Gond never takes food in the morning before going out
hunting, but goes out in a fasting condition perhaps in order that the
god, seeing his hunger, may send <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110"
href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>him some game to eat. Nor
will a Gond visit his wife the night before he goes out hunting. When a
Baiga goes out hunting he bangs his liquor-gourd on the ground before
his household god and vows that, if successful, he will offer to the
god the gourd full of liquor and a chicken. But if he returns
empty-handed, instead of doing this he fills the gourd with earth and
throws it over the god to show his wrath. Then if he is successful on
the next day, he will scrape off the earth and offer the liquor and
chicken as promised. A Baiga should worship his god and go out hunting
at the new moon, and then he will hunt the whole month. But if he has
not worshipped his god at the new moon, and still goes out hunting and
is unsuccessful, he will hunt no more that month. Some Gonds before
they go hunting draw an image of Mah&#257;b&#299;r or Hanum&#257;n, the
monkey god and the god of strength, on their guns, and rub it out when
they get home again.</p>

<h4 class="main">50. Witchcraft.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The belief in witchcraft has been till recently in
full force and vigour among the Gonds, and is only now showing symptoms
of decline. In 1871 Sir C. Grant wrote:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4512src" href="#xd21e4512" name="xd21e4512src">39</a> &ldquo;The
wild hill country from Mandla to the eastern coast is believed to be so
infested by witches that at one time no prudent father would let his
daughter marry into a family which did not include among its members at
least one of the dangerous sisterhood. The non-Aryan belief in the
power of evil here strikes a ready chord in the minds of their
conquerors, attuned to dread by the inhospitable appearance of the
country and the terrible effect of its malicious influences upon human
life. In the wilds of Mandla there are many deep hillside caves which
not even the most intrepid Baiga hunter would approach for fear of
attracting upon himself the wrath of their demoniac inhabitants; and
where these hillmen, who are regarded both by themselves and by others
as ministers between men and spirits, are afraid, the sleek cultivator
of the plains must feel absolute repulsion. Then the suddenness of the
epidemics to which, whether from deficient water-supply or other
causes, Central India seems so subject, is another fruitful source of
terror among an ignorant people. When cholera breaks out in a wild part
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>of the country it creates a perfect
stampede&mdash;villages, roads, and all works in progress are deserted;
even the sick are abandoned by their nearest relations to die, and
crowds fly to the jungles, there to starve on fruits and berries till
the panic has passed off. The only consideration for which their minds
have room at such times is the punishment of the offenders, for the
ravages caused by the disease are unhesitatingly set down to human
malice. The police records of the Central Provinces unfortunately
contain too many sad instances of life thus sacrificed to a mad
unreasoning terror.&rdquo; The detection of a witch by the agency of
the corpse, when the death is believed to have been caused by
witchcraft, has been described in the section on funeral rites. In
other cases a lamp was lighted and the names of the suspected persons
repeated; the flicker of the lamp at any name was held to indicate the
witch. Two leaves were thrown on the outstretched hand of a suspected
person, and if the leaf representing her or him fell above the other
suspicion was deepened. In Bastar the leaf ordeal was followed by
sewing the person accused into a sack and letting her down into shallow
water; if she managed in her struggles for life to raise her head above
water she was finally adjudged to be guilty. A witch was beaten with
rods of the tamarind or castor-oil plants, which were supposed to be of
peculiar efficacy in such cases; her head was shaved cross-wise from
one ear to the other over the head and down to the neck; her teeth were
sometimes knocked out, perhaps to prevent her from doing mischief if
she should assume the form of a tiger or other wild animal; she was
usually obliged to leave the village, and often murdered. Murder for
witchcraft is now comparatively rare as it is too often followed by
detection and proper punishment. But the belief in the causation of
epidemic disease by personal agency is only slowly declining. Such
measures as the disinfection of wells by permanganate of potash during
a visitation of cholera, or inoculation against plague, are sometimes
considered as attempts on the part of the Government to reduce the
population. When the first epidemic of plague broke out in Mandla in
1911 it caused a panic among the Gonds, who threatened to attack with
their axes any Government officer who should come to their village,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>in the belief that all of them must be
plague-inoculators. In the course of six months, however, the feeling
of panic died down under a system of instruction by schoolmasters and
other local officials and by circulars; and by the end of the period
the Gonds began to offer themselves voluntarily for inoculation, and
would probably have come to do so in fairly large numbers if the
epidemic had not subsided.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gonds were formerly accustomed to offer human
sacrifices, especially to the goddess K&#257;li and to the goddess
Danteshwari, the tutelary deity of the R&#257;jas of Bastar. Her shrine
was at a place called Dantew&#257;ra, and she was probably at first a
local goddess and afterwards identified with the Hindu goddess
K&#257;li. An inscription recently found in Bastar records the grant of
a village to a Medipota in order to secure the welfare of the people
and their cattle. This man was the head of a community whose business
it was, in return for the grants of land which they enjoyed, to supply
victims for human sacrifice either from their own families or
elsewhere. Tradition states that on one occasion as many as 101 persons
were sacrificed to avert some great calamity which had befallen the
country. And sacrifices also took place when the R&#257;ja visited the
temple. During the period of the Bhonsla rule early in the nineteenth
century the R&#257;ja of Bastar was said to have immolated twenty-five
men before he set out to visit the R&#257;ja of N&#257;gpur at his
capital. This would no doubt be as an offering for his safety, and the
lives of the victims were given as a substitute for his own. A guard
was afterwards placed on the temple by the Mar&#257;thas, but reports
show that human sacrifice was not finally stamped out until the
N&#257;gpur territories lapsed to the British in 1853. At Ch&#257;nda
and L&#257;nji also, Mr. Hislop states, human sacrifices were offered
until well into the nineteenth century<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4531src" href="#xd21e4531" name="xd21e4531src">41</a> at the
temples of K&#257;li. The victim was taken to the temple after sunset
and shut up within its dismal walls. In the morning, when the door was
opened, he was found dead, much to the glory of the great goddess, who
had shown her power by coming during the night and sucking his blood.
No doubt there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>must have been some of her servants hid in the
fane whose business it was to prepare the horrid banquet. It is said
that an iron plate was afterwards put over the face of the goddess to
prevent her from eating up the persons going before her. In Ch&#257;nda
the legend tells that the families of the town had each in turn to
supply a victim to the goddess. One day a mother was weeping bitterly
because her only son was to be taken as the victim, when an Ah&#299;r
passed by, and on learning the cause of her sorrow offered to go
instead. He took with him the rope of hair with which the Ah&#299;rs
tie the legs of their cows when milking them and made a noose out of
it. When the goddess came up to him he threw the noose over her neck
and drew it tight like a Thug. The goddess begged him to let her go,
and he agreed to do so on condition that she asked for no more human
victims. No doubt, if the legend has any foundation, the Ah&#299;r
found a human neck within his noose. It has been suggested in the
article on Thug that the goddess K&#257;li is really the deified tiger,
and if this were so her craving for human sacrifices is readily
understood. All the three places mentioned, Dantew&#257;ra, L&#257;nji
and Ch&#257;nda, are in a territory where tigers are still numerous,
and certain points in the above legends favour the idea of this animal
origin of the goddess. Such are the shutting of the victim in the
temple at night as an animal is tied up for a tiger-kill, and the
closing of her mouth with an iron plate as the mouths of tigers are
sometimes supposed to be closed by magic. Similarly it may perhaps be
believed that the R&#257;ja of Bastar offered human sacrifices to
protect himself and his party from the attacks of tigers, which would
be the principal danger on a journey to N&#257;gpur. In Mandla there is
a tradition that a Br&#257;hman boy was formerly sacrificed at
intervals to the god Bura Deo, and the forehead of the god was marked
with his hair in place of sandalwood, and the god bathed in his blood
and used his bones as sticks for playing at ball. Similarly in
Bindr&#257;naw&#257;garh in Raipur the Gonds are said to have entrapped
strangers and offered them to their gods, and if possible a
Br&#257;hman was obtained as the most suitable offering. These legends
indicate the traditional hostility of the Gonds to the Hindus, and
especially to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114"
name="pb114">114</a>]</span>Br&#257;hmans, by whom they were at one
time much oppressed and ousted from their lands. According to
tradition, a Gond R&#257;ja of Garha-Mandla, Madhkur Sh&#257;h, had
treacherously put his elder brother to death. Divine vengeance overtook
him and he became afflicted with chronic pains in the head. No
treatment was of avail, and he was finally advised that the only means
of appeasing a justly incensed deity was to offer his own life. He
determined to be burnt inside the trunk of the sacred p&#299;pal tree,
and a hollow trunk sufficiently dry for the purpose having been found
at Deogarh, twelve miles from Mandla, he shut himself up in it and was
burnt to death. The story is interesting as showing how the neurotic or
other pains, which are the result of remorse for a crime, are ascribed
to the vengeance of a divine providence.</p>

<p class="first">Mr. Wilson quotes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4550src"
href="#xd21e4550" name="xd21e4550src">42</a> an account, written by
Lieutenant Prendergast in 1820, in which he states that he had
discovered a tribe of Gonds who were cannibals, but ate only their own
relations. The account was as follows: &ldquo;In May 1820 I visited the
hills of Amarkantak, and having heard that a particular tribe of Gonds
who lived in the hills were cannibals, I made the most particular
inquiries assisted by my clerk Mohan Singh, an intelligent and
well-informed K&#257;yasth. We learned after much trouble that there
was a tribe of Gonds who resided in the hills of Amarkantak and to the
south-east in the Gondw&#257;na country, who held very little
intercourse with the villagers and never went among them except to
barter or purchase provisions. This race live in detached parties and
seldom have more than eight or ten huts in one place. They are
cannibals in the real sense of the word, but never eat the flesh of any
person not belonging to their own family or tribe; nor do they do this
except on particular occasions. It is the custom of this singular
people to cut the throat of any person of their family who is attacked
by severe illness and who they think has no chance of recovering, when
they collect the whole of their relations and friends, and feast upon
the body. In like manner when a person arrives at a great age and
becomes feeble and weak, the Hal&#257;lkhor operates upon him,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>when the different members of the family
assemble for the same purpose as above stated. In other respects this
is a simple race of people, nor do they consider cutting the throats of
their sick relations or aged parents any sin; but on the contrary an
act acceptable to K&#257;li, a blessing to their relatives, and a mercy
to their whole race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be noted that the account is based on hearsay only, and such
stories are often circulated about savage races. But if correct, it
would indicate probably only a ritual form of cannibalism. The idea of
the Gonds in eating the bodies of their relatives would be to
assimilate the lives of these as it were, and cause them to be reborn
as children in their own families. Possibly they ate the bodies of
their parents, as many races ate the bodies of animal gods, in order to
obtain their divine virtues and qualities. No corroboration of this
custom is known in respect of the Gonds, but Colonel Dalton
records<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4559src" href="#xd21e4559" name=
"xd21e4559src">43</a> a somewhat similar story of the small Birhor
tribe who live in the Chota N&#257;gpur hills not far from Amarkantak,

portions of the bodies of their dead relatives.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">The original Gond festivals were associated with the
first eating of the new crops and fruits. In Chait (March) a festival
called Chaitrai is observed in Bastar. A pig or fowl with some liquor
is offered to the village god, and the new urad and <i>semi</i> beans
of the year&rsquo;s crop are placed before him uncooked. The people
dance and sing the whole night and begin eating the new pulse and
beans. In Bh&#257;don (August) is the Naw&#257;khai or eating of the
new rice. The old and new grain is mixed and offered raw to the
ancestors, a goat is sacrificed, and they begin to eat the new crop of
rice. Similarly when the mahua flowers, from which country spirit is
made, first appear, they proceed to the forest and worship under a
<i>s&#257;j</i> tree.</p>
<p>Before sowing rice or millet they have a rite called
B&#299;jph&#363;tni or breaking the seed. Some grain, fowls and a pig
are collected from the villagers by subscription. The grain is offered
to the god and then distributed to all the villagers, who sow it in
their fields for luck. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href=

<h4 class="main">54. The Holi festival.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Holi festival, which corresponds to the Carnival,
being held in spring at the end of the Hindu year, is observed by Gonds
as well as Hindus. In Bil&#257;spur a Gond or Baiga, as representing
the oldest residents, is always employed to light the Holi fire.
Sometimes it is kindled in the ancient manner by the friction of two
pieces of wood. In Mandla, at the Holi, the Gonds fetch a green branch
of the <i>semar</i> or cotton tree and plant it in a little hole, in
which they put also a pice (farthing) and an egg. They place fuel round
and burn up the branch. Then next day they take out the egg and give it
to a dog to eat and say that this will make the dog as swift as fire.
They choose a dog whom they wish to train for hunting. They bring the
ploughshare from the house and heat it red-hot in the Holi fire and
take it back. They say that this wakes up the ploughshare, which has
fallen asleep from rusting in the house, and makes it sharp for
ploughing. Perhaps when rust appears on the metal they think this a
sign of its being asleep. They plough for the first time on a Monday or
Wednesday and drive three furrows when nobody is looking.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the western Districts on one of the five days
following the Holi the swinging rite is performed. For this they bring
a straight teak or <i>s&#257;j</i> tree from the forest, as long as can
be obtained, and cut from a place where two trees are growing together.
The Bhumka or village priest is shown in a dream where to cut the tree.
It is set up in a hole seven feet deep, a quantity of salt being placed
beneath it. The hole is coloured with <i>geru</i> or red ochre, and
offerings of goats, sheep and chickens are made to it by people who
have vowed them in sickness. A cross-bar is fixed on to the top of the
pole in a socket and the Bhumka is tied to one end of the cross-bar. A
rope is attached to the other end and the people take hold of this and
drag the Bhumka round in the air five times. When this has been done
the village proprietor gives him a present of a cocoanut, and head- and
body-clothes. If the pole falls down it is considered that some great
misfortune, such as an epidemic, will ensue. The pole and ritual are
now called Meghn&#257;th. Meghn&#257;th is held to have been the son of
R&#257;wan, the demon king of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117"
href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>Ceylon, from whom the Gonds
are supposed by the Hindus to be descended, as they are called
R&#257;wanvansi, or of the race of R&#257;wan. After this they set up
another pole, which is known as Jheri, and make it slippery with oil,
butter and other things. A little bag containing Rs. 1&ndash;4 and also
a seer (2 lbs.) of <i>gh&#299;</i> or butter are tied to the top, and
the men try to climb the pole and get these as a prize. The women
assemble and beat the men with sticks as they are climbing to prevent
them from doing so. If no man succeeds in climbing the pole and getting
the reward, it is given to the women. This seems to be a parody of the
first or Meghn&#257;th rite, and both probably have some connection
with the growth of the crops.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During Bh&#257;don (August), in the rains, the Gonds
bring a branch of the <i>kalmi</i> or of the <i>haldu</i> tree from the
forest and wrap it up in new cloth and keep it in their houses. They
have a feast and the musicians play, and men and women dance round the
branch singing songs, of which the theme is often sexual. The dance is
called Karma and is the principal dance of the Gonds, and they repeat
it at intervals all through the cold weather, considering it as their
great amusement. A further notice of it is given in the section on
social customs. The dance is apparently named after the tree, though it
is not known whether the same tree is always selected. Many deciduous
trees in India shed their leaves in the hot weather and renew them in
the rains, so that this season is partly one of the renewal of
vegetation as well as of the growth of crops.</p>

<p>In Kunw&#257;r (September) the Gond girls take an earthen pot,
pierce it with holes, and put a lamp inside and also the image of a
dove, and go round from house to house singing and dancing, led by a
girl carrying the pot on her head. They collect contributions and have
a feast. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh among the Gonds and R&#257;wats
(Ah&#299;rs) there is from time to time a kind of feminist movement,
which is called the Stiria-R&#257;j or kingdom of women. The women
pretend to be soldiers, seize all the weapons, axes and spears that
they can get hold of, and march in a body from village to village. At
each village they kill a goat and send its head to another village, and
then the women of that village come and join <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=

unbound and think that they are establishing the kingdom of women.
After some months the movement subsides, and it is said to occur at
irregular intervals with a number of years between each. The women are
commonly considered to be out of their senses.</p>

"xd21e4642src">45</a> &ldquo;All are a little below the average size of
Europeans and in complexion darker than the generality of Hindus. Their
bodies are well proportioned, but their features rather ugly. They have
a roundish head, distended nostrils, wide mouth, thickish lips,
straight black hair and scanty beard and moustache. It has been
supposed that some of the aborigines of Central India have woolly hair;
but this is a mistake. Among the thousands I have seen I have not found
one with hair like a negro.&rdquo; Captain Forsyth says:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4647src" href="#xd21e4647" name=
"xd21e4647src">46</a> &ldquo;The Gond women differ among themselves
more than the men. They are somewhat lighter in colour and less fleshy
than Korku women. But the Gond women of different parts of the country
vary greatly in appearance, many of them in the open tracts being great
robust creatures, finer animals by far than the men; and here Hindu
blood may fairly be expected. In the interior again bevies of Gond
women may be seen who are more like monkeys than human beings. The
features of all are strongly marked and coarse. The girls occasionally
possess such comeliness as attaches to general plumpness and a
good-humoured expression of face; but when their short youth is over
all pass at once into a hideous age. Their hard lives, sharing as they
do all the labours of the men except that of hunting, suffice to
account for this.&rdquo; There is not the least doubt that the Gonds of
the more open and civilised country, comprised in British Districts,
have a large admixture of Hindu blood. They commonly work as
farmservants, women as well as men, and illicit connections with their
Hindu masters have been a natural result. This <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>interbreeding, as well as the better quality of
food which those who have taken to regular cultivation obtain, have
perhaps conduced to improve the Gond physical type. Gond men as tall as
Hindus, and more strongly built and with comparatively well-cut
features, are now frequently seen, though the broad flat nose is still
characteristic of the tribe as a whole. Most Gonds have very little
hair on the face.</p>

<h4 class="main">58. Character.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the M&#257;ria Gonds, Colonel Glasfurd
wrote<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4659src" href="#xd21e4659" name=
"xd21e4659src">47</a> that &ldquo;They are a timid, quiet race, docile,
and though addicted to drinking they are not quarrelsome. Without
exception they are the most cheerful, light-hearted people I have met
with, always laughing and joking among themselves. Seldom does a
M&#257;ria village resound with quarrels or wrangling among either sex,
and in this respect they present a marked contrast to those in more
civilised tracts. They, in common with many other wild races, bear a
singular character for truthfulness and honesty, and when once they get
over the feeling of shyness which is natural to them, are exceedingly
frank and communicative.&rdquo; Writing in 1825 Sleeman said:
&ldquo;Such is the simplicity and honesty of character of the wildest
of these Gonds that when they have agreed to a <i>jama</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4666src" href="#xd21e4666" name=
"xd21e4666src">48</a> they will pay it, though they sell their children
to do so, and will also pay it at the precise time that they agreed to.
They are dishonest only in direct theft, and few of them will refuse to
take another man&rsquo;s property when a fair occasion offers, but they
will immediately acknowledge it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4669src" href="#xd21e4669" name="xd21e4669src">49</a> The more
civilised Gonds retain these characteristics to a large extent, though
contact with the Hindus and the increased complexity of life have
rendered them less guileless. Murder is a comparatively frequent crime
among Gonds, and is usually due either to some quarrel about a woman or
to a drunken affray. The kidnapping of girls for marriage is also
common, though hardly reckoned as an offence by the Gonds themselves.
Otherwise crime is extremely rare in Gond villages as a rule. As
farmservants the Gonds are esteemed fairly honest and hard-working; but
unless well driven they are constitutionally averse to labour, and care
nothing about provision for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120"
href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>future. The proverb says,
&lsquo;The Gond considers himself a king as long as he has a pot of
grain in the house,&rsquo; meaning that while he has food for a day or
two he will not work for any more. During the hot weather the Gonds go
about in parties and pay visits to their relatives, staying with them
several days, and the time is spent simply in eating, drinking when
liquor is available, and conversation. The visitors take presents of
grain and pulse with them and these go to augment the host&rsquo;s
resources. The latter will kill a chicken or, as a great treat, a young
pig. Mr. Montgomerie writes of the Gonds as follows:<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4677src" href="#xd21e4677" name="xd21e4677src">50</a>
&ldquo;They are a pleasant people, and leave kindly memories in those
who have to do with them. Comparatively truthful, always ready for a
laugh, familiar with the paths and animals and fruits of the forest,
lazy cultivators on their own account but good farmservants under
supervision, the broad-nosed Gonds are the fit inhabitants of the hilly
and jungly tracts in which they are found. With a marigold tucked into
his hair above his left ear, with an axe in his hand and a grin on his
face, the Gond turns out cheerfully to beat for game, and at the end of
the day spends his beating pay on liquor for himself or on sweetmeats
for his children. He may, in the previous year, have been subsisting
largely on jungle fruits and roots because his harvest failed, but he
does not dream of investing his modest beating pay in grain.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="main">59. Shyness and ignorance.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the wilder tracts the Gonds were, until recently,
extremely shy of strangers, and would fly at their approach. Their
tribute to the R&#257;ja of Bastar, paid in kind, was collected once a
year by an officer who beat a tom-tom outside the village and forthwith
hid himself, whereupon the inhabitants brought out whatever they had to
give and deposited it on an appointed spot. Colonel Glasfurd notes that
they had great fear of a horse, and the sight of a man on horseback
would put a whole village to flight.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4686src" href="#xd21e4686" name="xd21e4686src">51</a> Even within
the writer&rsquo;s experience, in the wilder forest tracts of
Ch&#257;nda Gond women picking up mahua would run and climb a tree at
one&rsquo;s approach on a pony. As displaying the ignorance of the
Gonds, Mr. Cain relates<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4691src" href=
"#xd21e4691" name="xd21e4691src">52</a> that about forty years ago a
Gond <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>was sent with a basket of mangoes from Palvatsa
to Bhadrachalam, and was warned not to eat any of the fruit, as it
would be known if he did so from a note placed in the basket. On the
way, however, the Gond and his companion were overcome by the
attraction of the fruit, and decided that if they buried the note it
would be unable to see them eating. They accordingly did so and ate
some of the mangoes, and when taxed with their dishonesty at the
journey&rsquo;s end, could not understand how the note could have known
of their eating the mangoes when it had not seen them.</p>
<p>The Gonds can now count up to twenty, and beyond that they use the
word <i>kori</i> or a score, in talking of cattle, grain or rupees, so
that this, perhaps, takes them up to twenty score. They say they learnt
to count up to twenty on their ten fingers and ten toes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e4703">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">60. Villages and houses.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When residing in the centre of a Hindu population the
Gonds inhabit mud houses, like the low-class Hindus. But in the jungles
their huts are of bamboo matting plastered with mud, with thatched
roofs. The internal arrangements are of the simplest kind, comprising
two apartments separated from each other by a row of tall baskets, in
which they store up their grain. Adjoining the house is a shed for
cattle, and round both a bamboo fence for protection from wild beasts.
In Bastar the walls of the hut are only four or five feet high, and the
door three feet. Here there are one or two sheds, in which all the
villagers store their grain in common, and no man steals
another&rsquo;s grain. In Gond villages the houses are seen perched
about on little bluffs or other high ground, overlooking the fields,
one, two and three together. The Gond does not like to live in a
street. He likes a large <i>b&#257;ri</i> or fenced enclosure, about an
acre in size, besides his house. In this he will grow mustard for sale,
or his own annual supply of tobacco or vegetables. He arranges that the
village cattle shall come and stand in the <i>b&#257;ri</i> on their
way to and from pasture, and that the cows shall be milked there for
some time. His family also perform natural functions in it, which the
Hindus will not do in their fields. Thus the <i>b&#257;ri</i> gets well
manured and will easily give two crops in the year, and the Gond sets
great store by this field. When building a new house a man plants as
the first post a pole <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>of the <i>s&#257;j</i> tree, and
ties a bundle of thatching-grass round it, and buries a pice
(&frac14;d.) and a <i>bhilawa</i> nut beneath it. They feed two or
three friends and scatter a little of the food over the post. The post
is called Khirkhut Deo, and protects the house from harm.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">61. Clothes and ornaments.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Sir R. Jenkins&rsquo; time, a century ago, the
Gonds were represented as naked savages, living on roots and fruits,
and hunting for strangers to sacrifice. About fifty years later, when
Mr. Hislop wrote, the M&#257;ria women of the wilder tracts were said
only to have a bundle of leafy twigs fastened with a string round their
waist to cover them before and behind. Now men have a narrow strip of
cloth round the waist and women a broader one, but in the south of
Bastar they still leave their breasts uncovered. Here a woman covers
her breasts for the first time when she becomes pregnant, and if a
young woman did it, she would be thought to be big with child. In other
localities men and women clothe themselves more like Hindus, but the
women leave the greater part of the thighs bare, and men often have
only one cloth round the loins and another small rag on the head. They
have bangles of glass, brass and zinc, and large circlets of brass
round the legs, though these are now being discarded. In Bastar both
men and women have ten to twenty iron and brass hoops round their
necks, and on to these rings of the same metal are strung. Rai
Bah&#257;dur Panda Baijn&#257;th counted 181 rings on one hoop round an
old woman&rsquo;s neck. In the M&#257;ria country the boys have small
separate plots of land, which they cultivate themselves and use the
proceeds as their pocket-money, and this enables them to indulge in a
profusion of ornaments sometimes exceeding those worn by the girls. In
Mandla women wear a number of strings of yellow and bluish-white beads.
A married woman has both colours, and several cowries tied to the end
of the necklace. Widows and girls may only wear the bluish-white beads
without cowries, and a remarried widow may not have any yellow beads,
but she can have one cowrie on her necklace. Yellow beads are thus
confined to married <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123"
name="pb123">123</a>]</span>women, yellow being the common
wedding-colour. A Gond woman is not allowed to wear a <i>choli</i> or
little jacket over the breasts. If she does she is put out of caste.
This rule may arise from opposition to the adoption of Hindu customs
and desire to retain a distinctive feature of dress, or it may be
thought that the adoption of the <i>choli</i> might make Gond women
weaker and unfitted for hard manual labour, like Hindu women. A Gond
woman must not keep her cloth tucked up behind into her waist when she
meets an elderly man of her own family, but must let it down so as to
cover the upper part of her legs. If she omits to do this, on the
occasion of the next wedding the Bhumka or caste priest will send some
men to catch her, and when she is brought the man to whom she was
disrespectful will put his right hand on the ground and she must make
obeisance to it seven times, then to his left hand, then to a broom and
pestle, and so on till she is tired out. When they have a sprain or
swelling of the arm they make a ring of tree-fibre and wear this on the
arm, and think that it will cure the sprain or swelling.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The ears of girls are pierced by a thorn, and the hole
is enlarged by putting in small pieces of wood or peacock&rsquo;s
feathers. Gond women wear in their ears the <i>tarkhi</i> or a little
slab in shape like a palm-leaf, covered with coloured glass and fixed
on to a stalk of hemp-fibre nearly an inch thick, which goes through
the ear; or they wear the silver shield-shaped ornament called
<i>dh&#257;ra</i>, which is described in the article on Sun&#257;r. In
Bastar the women have their ears pierced in a dozen or more places, and
have a small ring in each hole. If a woman gets her ear torn through
she is simply put out of caste and has to give a feast for readmission,
and is not kept out of caste till it heals, like a Hindu woman.</p>

obtainable it is said that they used to tie it up on their heads and
chop off the ends with an axe, or burn them off. But the wilder Gonds
often wear their hair long, and as it is seldom combed it gets tangled
and matted. The Pandas or priests do not cut their hair. Women wear
braids of false hair, of goats or other animals, twisted into their own
to improve their appearance. In Mandla a Gond girl should not have her
hair <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=

she is married this is done for the first time by the Baiga, who

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Gonds, both men and women, do not bathe daily, but
only wash their arms and legs. They think a complete bath once a month
is sufficient. If a man gets ill he may think the god is angry with him
for not bathing, and when he recovers he goes and has a good bath, and
sometimes gives a feast. Hindus say that a Gond is only clean in the
rains, when he gets a compulsory bath every day. In Bastar they seldom
wash their clothes, as they think this impious, or else that the cloth
would wear out too quickly if it were often washed. Here they set great
store by their piece of cloth, and a woman will take it off before she
cleans up her house, and do her work naked. It is probable that these
wild Gonds, who could not weave, regarded the cloth as something
miraculous and sacred, and, as already seen, the god P&#257;lo is a
piece of cloth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4781src" href="#xd21e4781"

<p>Both men and women were formerly much tattooed among the Gonds,
though the custom is now going out among men. Women are tattooed over a
large part of the body, but not on the hips or above them to the waist.
Sorcerers are tattooed with some image or symbol of their god on their
chest or right shoulder, and think that the god will thus always remain
with them and that any magic directed against them by an enemy will
fail. A woman should be tattooed at her father&rsquo;s house, if
possible before marriage, and if it is done after marriage her parents
should pay for it. The tattooing is done with indigo in black or blue,
and is sometimes a very painful process, the girl being held down by
her friends while it is carried out. Loud shrieks, Forsyth says, would
sometimes be heard by the traveller issuing from a village, which
proclaimed that some young Gondin was being operated upon with the
tattooing-needle. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"
name="pb125">125</a>]</span>Patterns of animals and also common
articles of household use are tattooed in dots and lines. In Mandla the
legs are marked all the way up behind with sets of parallel lines, as
shown above. These are called <i>gh&#257;ts</i> or steps, and sometimes
interspersed at intervals is another figure called <i>s&#257;nkal</i>
or chain. Perhaps their idea is to make the legs strong for
climbing.</p>

<h4 class="main">66. Special system of tattooing.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Tattooing seems to have been originally a magical
means of protecting the body against real and spiritual dangers, much
in the same manner as the wearing of ornaments. It is also supposed
that people were tattooed with images of their totem in order the
better to identify themselves with it. The following account is stated
to have been taken from the Baiga priest of a popular shrine of Devi in
Mandla. His wife was a tattooer of both Baigas and Gonds, and
considered it the correct method for the full tattooing of a woman,
though very few women can nowadays be found with it. The magical intent
of tattooing is here clearly brought out:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figure xd21e4811width"><img src="images/fig125-1.png" alt=
"" width="40" height="62"></div>
<p>It represents the earth, and will have the effect of preventing the
woman&rsquo;s foot from being bruised and cut when she walks about
barefoot.</p>
<p>On the sole of the left foot is this pattern:</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4818width"><img src="images/fig125-2.png" alt=
"" width="110" height="61"></div>
<p>It is meant to be in the shape of a foot, and is called Padam Sen
Deo or the Foot-god. This deity is represented by stones marked with
two footprints under a tree outside the village. When they have a pain
in the foot they go to him, rub his two stones together and sprinkle
the dust from them on their feet as a means of cure. The device
tattooed on the foot no doubt performs a similar protective
function.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4823width"><img src="images/fig126.png" alt=""
width="192" height="78"></div>
<p>On the upper part of the foot five dots are made, one on each toe,
and a line is drawn round the foot from the big toe to the little toe.
This sign is said to represent Gajkaran <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>Deo, the elephant
god, who resides in cemeteries. He is a strong god, and it is probably
thought that his symbol on the feet will enable them to bear weight. On
the legs behind they have the images of the Baiga priest and priestess.
These are also supposed to give strength for labour, and when they
cannot go into the forest from fever or weakness they say that Bura
Deo, as the deified priest is called, is angry with them. On the upper
legs in front they tattoo the image of a horse, and at the back a
saddle between the knee and the thigh. This is Koda Deo the horse-god,
whose image will make their thighs as strong as those of a horse. If
they have a pain or weakness in the thigh they go and worship Koda Deo,
offering him a piece of saddle-cloth. On the outer side of each upper
arm they tattoo the image of Hanum&#257;n, the deified monkey and the
god of strength, in the form of a man. Both men and women do this, and
men apply burning cowdung to the tattoo-mark in order to burn it
effectually into the arm. This god makes the arms strong to carry
weights. Down the back is tattooed an oblong figure, which is the house
of the god Bhimsen, with an opening at the lower end just above the
buttocks to represent the gate. Inside this on the back is the image of
Bhimsen&rsquo;s club, consisting of a pattern of dots more or less in
the shape of an Indian club. Bhimsen is the god of the cooking-place,
and the image of his club, in white clay stained green with the leaves
of the <i>semar</i> tree, is made on the wall of the kitchen. If they
have no food, or the food is bad, they say that Bhimsen is angry with
them. The pattern tattooed on the back appears therefore to be meant to
facilitate the digestion of food, which the Gonds apparently once
supposed to pass down the body along the back. On the breast in front
women tattoo the image of Bura Deo, as shown, the head on her neck and
the body finishing at her breast-bone. The marks round the body
represent stones, because the symbol of Bura Deo is sometimes a basket
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>plastered with mud and filled with stones. On
each side of the body women have the image of Jhul&#257;n Devi, the
cradle goddess, as shown by the small figures attached to Bura Deo. But
a woman cannot have the image of Jhul&#257;n Devi tattooed on her till
she has borne a child. The place where the image is tattooed is that
where a child rests against its mother&rsquo;s body when she carries it
suspended in her cloth, and it is supposed that the image of the
goddess supports and protects the child, while the mother&rsquo;s arms
are left free for work.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Gond women, showing tattooing on backs of

</div>
<p>Round the neck they have Kanteshwar M&#257;ta, the goddess of the
necklace. She consists of three to six lines of dots round the neck
representing bead necklaces.</p>
<p>On the face below the mouth there is sometimes the image of a cobra,
and it is supposed that this will protect them from the effects of
eating any poisonous thing.</p>
<p>On the forehead women have the image of Ch&#257;ndi M&#257;ta. This
consists of a dot at the forehead at the parting of the hair, from
which two lines of dots run down to the ears on each side, and are
continued along the sides of the face to the neck. This image can only
be tattooed after the hair of a woman has been parted on her marriage,
and they say that Ch&#257;ndi M&#257;ta will preserve and guard the
parting of the hair, that is the life of the woman&rsquo;s husband,
because the parting can only be worn so long as her husband is alive.
Ch&#257;ndi means the moon, and it seems likely that the parting of the
hair may be considered to represent the bow of the moon.</p>
<p>The elaborate system of tattooing here described is rarely found,
and it is perhaps comparatively recent, having been devised by the
Baiga and Pardh&#257;n priests as their intelligence developed and
their theogony became more complex.</p>

<h4 class="main">67. Branding.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Men are accustomed to brand themselves on the joints
of the wrists, elbows and knees with burning wood of the <i>semar</i>
tree from the Holi fire in order to render their joints supple for
dancing. It would appear that the idea of suppleness comes from the
dancing of the flames or the swift burning of the fire, while the wood
is also of very light weight. Men are also accustomed to burn two or
three marks on each wrist with a piece of hare&rsquo;s dung, perhaps to
make the joints supple like the legs of a hare. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">68. Food.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gonds have scarcely any restriction on diet. They
will eat fowls, beef, pork, crocodiles, certain kinds of snakes,
lizards, tortoises, rats, cats, red ants, jackals and in some places
monkeys. Khatola and R&#257;j-Gonds usually abstain from beef and the
flesh of the buffalo and monkey. They consider field-mice and rats a
great delicacy, and will take much trouble in finding and digging out
their holes. The M&#257;ria Gonds are very fond of red ants, and in
Bastar give them fried or roasted to a woman during her confinement.
The common food of the labouring Gond is a gruel of rice or small
millet boiled in water, the quantity of water increasing in proportion
to their poverty. This is about the cheapest kind of food on which a
man can live, and the quantity of grain taken in the form of this gruel
or <i>pej</i> which will suffice for a Gond&rsquo;s subsistence is
astonishingly small. They grow the small grass-millets kodon and kutki
for their subsistence, selling the more valuable crops for rent and
expenses. The flowers of the mahua tree are also a staple article of
diet, being largely eaten as well as made into liquor, and the Gond
knows of many other roots and fruits of the forest. He likes to eat or
drink his <i>pej</i> several times a day, and in Seoni, it is said,
will not go more than three hours without a meal.</p>
<p>Gonds are rather strict in the matter of taking food from others,
and in some localities refuse to accept it even from Br&#257;hmans.
Elsewhere they will take it from most Hindu castes. In
Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d the men may take food from the higher Hindu
castes, but not the women. This, they say, is because the woman is a
wooden vessel, and if a wooden vessel is once put on the fire it is
irretrievably burnt. A woman similarly is the weaker vessel and will
sustain injury from any contamination. The R&#257;j-Gond copies Hindu
ways and outdoes the Hindu in the elaboration of ceremonial purity,
even having the fuel with which his Br&#257;hman cook prepares his food
sprinkled with water to purify it before it is burnt. Mr. A. K. Smith
states that a Gond will not eat an antelope if a Cham&#257;r has
touched it, even unskinned, and in some places they are so strict that
a wife may not eat her husband&rsquo;s leavings of food. The Gonds will
not eat the leavings of any Hindu <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129"
href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>caste, probably on account of
a traditional hostility arising out of their subjection by the Hindus.
Very few Hindu castes will take water or food from the Gonds, but some
who employ them as farmservants do this for convenience. The Gonds are
not regarded as impure, even though from a Hindu point of view some of
their habits are more objectionable than those of the impure castes.
This is because the Gonds have never been completely reduced to
subjection, nor converted into the village drudges, who are consigned
to the most degraded occupations. Large numbers of them hold land as
tenants and estates as zam&#299;nd&#257;rs; and the greater part of the
Province was once governed by Gond kings. The Hindus say that they
could not consider a tribe as impure to which their kings once
belonged. Br&#257;hmans will take water from R&#257;j-Gonds and Khatola
Gonds in many localities. This is when it is freshly brought from the
well and not after it has been put in their houses.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e4874">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">69. Liquor.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Excessive drinking is the common vice of the Gonds and
the principal cause which militates against their successfully
competing with the Hindus. They drink the country spirit distilled from
the flowers of the mahua tree, and in the south of the Province toddy
or the fermented juice of the date-palm. As already seen, in Bastar
their idea of hell is a place without liquor. The loss of the greater
part of the estates formerly held by Gond proprietors has been due to
this vice, which many Hindu liquor-sellers have naturally fostered to
their own advantage. No festival or wedding passes without a drunken
bout, and in Ch&#257;nda at the season for tapping the date-palm trees
the whole population of a village may be seen lying about in the open
dead drunk. They impute a certain sanctity to the mahua tree, and in
some places walk round a post of it at their weddings. Liquor is
indispensable at all ceremonial feasts, and a purifying quality is
attributed to it, so that it is drunk at the cemetery or
bathing-<i>gh&#257;t</i> after a funeral. The family arranges for
liquor, but mourners attending from other families also bring a bottle
each with them, if possible. Practically all the events of a
Gond&rsquo;s life, the birth of a child, betrothals and weddings,
recovery from sickness, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>arrival of a guest, bringing home
the harvest, borrowing money or hiring bullocks, and making contracts
for cultivation, are celebrated by drinking. And when a Gond has once
begun to drink, if he has the money he usually goes on till he is
drunk, and this is why the habit is such a curse to him. He is of a
social disposition and does not like to drink alone. If he has drunk
something, and has no more money, and the contractor refuses to let him
have any more on credit as the law prescribes, the Gond will sometimes
curse him and swear never to drink in his shop again. Nevertheless,
within a few days he will be back, and when chaffed about it will
answer simply that he could not resist the longing. In spite of all the
harm it does him, it must be admitted that it is the drink which gives
most of the colour and brightness to a Gond&rsquo;s life, and without
this it would usually be tame to a degree.</p>
<p>When a Gond drinks water from a stream or tank, he bends down and
puts his mouth to the surface and does not make a cup with his hands
like a Hindu.</p>

<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e4886">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">70. Admission of outsiders and sexual morality.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Outsiders are admitted into the tribe in some
localities in Bastar, and also the offspring of a Gond man or woman
with a person of another caste, excepting the lowest. But some people
will not admit the children of a Gond woman by a man of another caste.
Not much regard is paid to the chastity of girls before marriage,
though in the more civilised tracts the stricter Hindu views on the
subject are beginning to prevail. Here it is said that if a girl is
detected in a sexual intrigue before marriage she may be taken into
caste, but may not participate in the worship of Bura Deo nor of the
household god. But this is probably rather a counsel of perfection than
a rule actually enforced. If a daughter is taken in the sexual act,
they think some misfortune will happen to them, as the death of a cow
or the failure of crops. Similarly the M&#257;ria Gonds think that if
tigers kill their cattle it is a punishment for the adultery of their
wives, and hence if a man loses a head or two he looks very closely
after his wife, and detection is often followed by murder. Here
probably adultery was originally considered an offence as being a sin
against the tribe, because it contaminated the tribal blood, and out of
this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>attitude marital jealousy has subsequently
developed. Speaking generally, the enforcement of rules of sexual
morality appears to be comparatively recent, and there is no doubt that
the Baigas and other tribes who have lived in contact with the Gonds,
as well as the Ah&#299;rs and other low castes, have a large admixture
of Gond blood. In Bastar a Gond woman formerly had no feelings of
modesty as regards her breasts, but this is now being acquired. Laying
the hand on a married woman&rsquo;s shoulder gives great offence. Mr.
Low writes:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4893src" href="#xd21e4893" name=
"xd21e4893src">55</a> &ldquo;It is difficult to say what is not a legal
marriage from a Gond point of view; but in spite of this laxity
abductions are frequent, and Colonel Bloomfield mentions one
particularly noteworthy case where the abductor, an unusually ugly Gond
with a hare-lip, was stated by the complainant to have taken off first
the latter&rsquo;s aunt, then his sister and finally his only
wife.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e4898">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">71. Common sleeping-houses.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many Gond villages in Chhatt&#299;sgarh and the
Feudatory States have what is known as a <i>gotalghar</i>. This is a
large house near the village where unmarried youths and maidens collect
and dance and sing together at night. Some villages have two, one for
the boys and one for the girls. In Bastar the boys have a regular
organisation, their captain being called Sird&#257;r, and the master of
the ceremonies Kotw&#257;r, while they have other officials bearing the
designation of the State officers. After supper the unmarried boys go
first to the <i>gotalghar</i> and are followed by the girls. The
Kotw&#257;r receives the latter and directs them to bow to the
Sird&#257;r, which they do. Each girl then takes a boy and combs his
hair and massages his hands and arms to refresh him, and afterwards
they sing and dance together until they are tired and then go to bed.
The girls can retire to their own house if they wish, but frequently
they sleep in the boys&rsquo; house. Thus numerous couples become
intimate, and if on discovery the parents object to their marriage,
they run away to the jungle, and it has to be recognised. In some
villages, however, girls are not permitted to go to the
<i>gotalghar</i>. In one part of Bastar they have a curious rule that
all males, even the married, must sleep in the common house for the
eight <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>months of the open season, while their wives
sleep in their own houses. A M&#257;ria Gond thinks it impious to have
sexual intercourse with his wife in his house, as it would be an insult
to the goddess of wealth who lives in the house, and the effect would
be to drive her away. Their solicitude for this goddess is the more
noticeable, as the M&#257;ria Gond&rsquo;s house and furniture probably
constitute one of the least valuable human habitations on the face of
the globe.</p>

<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e4914">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">72. Methods of greeting and observances between
relatives.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When two Gond friends or relatives meet, they clasp
each other in their arms and lean against each shoulder in turn. A man
will then touch the knees of an elder male relative with his fingers,
carrying them afterwards to his own forehead. This is equivalent to
falling at the other&rsquo;s feet, and is a token of respect shown to
all elder male relatives and also to a son-in-law, sister&rsquo;s
husband, and a <i>samhdi</i>, that is the father of a son- or
daughter-in-law. Their term of salutation is Joh&#257;r, and they say
this to each other. Another method of greeting is that each should put
his fingers under the other&rsquo;s chin and then kiss them himself.
Women also do this when they meet. Or a younger woman meeting an elder
will touch her feet, and the elder will then kiss her on the forehead
and on each cheek. If they have not met for some time they will weep.
It is said that Baigas will kiss each other on the cheek when meeting,
both men and women. A Gond will kiss and caress his wife after
marriage, but as soon as she has a child he drops the habit and never
does it again. When husband and wife meet after an absence the wife
touches her husband&rsquo;s feet with her hand and carries it to her
forehead, but the husband makes no demonstration. The Gonds kiss their
children. Among the M&#257;ria Gonds the wife is said not to sleep on a
cot in her husband&rsquo;s house, which would be thought disrespectful
to him, but on the ground. Nor will a woman even sit on a cot in her
own house, as if any male relative happened to be in the house it would
be disrespectful to him. A woman will not say the name of her husband,
his elder or younger brother, or his elder brother&rsquo;s sons. A man
will not mention his wife&rsquo;s name nor that of her elder
sister.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e4922">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">73. The caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> and social
offences.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tribe have <i>panch&#257;yats</i> or committees
for the settlement of tribal disputes and offences. A member of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span><i>panch&#257;yat</i> is selected by general
consent, and holds office during good behaviour. The office is not
hereditary, and generally there does not seem to be a recognised head
of the <i>panch&#257;yat</i>. In Mandla there is a separate
<i>panch&#257;yat</i> for each village, and every Gond male adult
belongs to it, and all have to be summoned to a meeting. When they
assemble five leading elderly men decide the matter in dispute, as
representing the assembly. Caste offences are of the usual Hindu type
with some variations. Adultery, taking another man&rsquo;s wife or
daughter, getting vermin in a wound, being sent to jail and eating the
jail food, or even having handcuffs put on, a woman getting her ear
torn, and eating or even smoking with a man of very low caste, are the
ordinary offences. Others are being beaten by a shoe, dealing in the
hides of cattle or keeping donkeys, removing the corpse of a dead horse
or donkey, being touched by a sweeper, cooking in the earthen pots of
any impure caste, a woman entering the kitchen during her monthly
impurity, and taking to wife the widow of a younger brother, but not of
course of an elder brother.</p>
<p>In the case of septs which revere a totem animal or plant, any act
committed in connection with that animal or plant by a member of the
sept is an offence within the cognisance of the <i>panch&#257;yat</i>.
Thus in Mandla the Kumhra sept revere the goat and the Mark&#257;m sept
the crocodile and crab. If a member of one of these septs touches,
keeps, kills or eats the animal which his sept reveres, he is put out
of caste and comes before the <i>panch&#257;yat</i>. In practice the
offences with which the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> most frequently deals are
the taking of another man&rsquo;s wife or the kidnapping of a daughter
for marriage, this last usually occurring between relatives. Both these
offences can also be brought before the regular courts, but it is
usually only when the aggrieved person cannot get satisfaction from the
<i>panch&#257;yat</i>, or when the offender refuses to abide by its
decision, that the case goes to court. If a Gond loses his wife he will
in the ordinary course compromise the matter if the man who takes her
will repay his wedding expenses; this is a very serious business for
him, as his wedding is the principal expense of a man&rsquo;s life, and
it is probable that he may not be able to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>afford to buy another
girl and pay for her wedding. If he cannot get his wedding expenses
back through the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> he files a complaint of adultery
under the Penal Code, in the hope of being repaid through a fine
inflicted on the offender, and it is perfectly right and just that this
should be done. When a girl is kidnapped for marriage, her family can
usually be induced to recognise the affair if they receive the price
they could have got for the girl in an ordinary marriage, and perhaps a
little more, as a solace to their outraged feelings.</p>
<p>The <i>panch&#257;yat</i> takes no cognisance of theft, cheating,
forgery, perjury, causing hurt and other forms of crime. These are not
considered to be offences against the caste, and no penalty is
inflicted for them. Only if a man is arrested and handcuffed, or if he
is sent to jail for any such crime, he is put out of caste for eating
the jail food and subjected in this latter case to a somewhat severe
penalty. It is not clear whether a Gond is put out of caste for murder,
though Hindu <i>panch&#257;yats</i> take cognisance of this
offence.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e4971">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">74. Caste penalty feasts.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The punishments inflicted by the <i>panch&#257;yat</i>
consist of feasts, and in the case of minor offences of a fine. This
last, subject perhaps to some commission to the members for their
services, is always spent on liquor, the drinking of which by the
offender with the caste-fellows will purify him. The Gonds consider
country liquor as equivalent to the Hindu Amrita or nectar.</p>
<p>The penalty for a serious offence involves three feasts. The first,
known as the meal of impurity, consists of sweet wheaten cakes which
are eaten by the elders on the bank of a stream or well. The second or
main feast is given in the offender&rsquo;s courtyard to all the
castemen of the village and sometimes of other villages. Rice, pulse,
and meat, either of a slaughtered pig or goat, are provided at this.
The third feast is known as &lsquo;The taking back into caste&rsquo;
and is held in the offender&rsquo;s house and may be cooked by him.
Wheat, rice and pulses are served, but not meat or vegetables. When the
<i>panch&#257;yat</i> have eaten this food in the offender&rsquo;s
house he is again a proper member of the caste. Liquor is essential at
each feast. The nature of the penalty feasts is thus very clear. They
have the effect of a gradual purification of the offender. In the first
meal he can take no part, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href=
"#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>nor is it served in his house, but
in some neutral place. For the second meal the castemen go so far as to
sit in his compound, but apparently he does not cook the food nor
partake of it. At the third meal they eat with him in his house and he
is fully purified. These three meals are prescribed only for serious
offences, and for ordinary ones only two meals, the offender partaking
of the second. The three meals are usually exacted from a woman taken
in adultery with an outsider. In this case the woman&rsquo;s head is
shaved at the first meal by the Sharmia, that is her son-in-law, and
the children put her to shame by throwing lumps of cowdung at her. She
runs away and bathes in a stream. At the second meal, taken in her
courtyard, the Sharmia sprinkles some blood on the ground and on the
lintel of the door as an offering to the gods and in order that the
house may be pure for the future. If a man is poor and cannot afford
the expense of the penalty feasts imposed on him, the
<i>panch&#257;yat</i> will agree that only a few persons will attend
instead of the whole community. The procedure above described is
probably borrowed to a large extent from Hinduism, but the working of a
<i>panch&#257;yat</i> can be observed better among the Gonds and lower
castes than among high-caste Hindus, who are tending to let it lapse
into abeyance.</p>

<h4 class="main">75. Special purification ceremony.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following detailed process of purification had to
be undergone by a well-to-do Gond widow in Mandla who had been detected
with a man of the Panka caste, lying drunk and naked in a liquor-shop.
The Gonds here consider the Pankas socially beneath themselves. The
ritual clearly belongs to Hinduism, as shown by the purifying virtue
attached to contact with cows and bullocks and cowdung, and was
directed by the Panda or priest of Devi&rsquo;s shrine, who, however,
would probably be a Gond. First, the offending woman was taken right
out of the village across a stream; here her head was shaved with the
urine of an all-black bullock and her body washed with his dung, and
she then bathed in the stream, and a feast was given on its bank to the
caste. She slept here, and next day was yoked to the same bullock and
taken thus to the Kharkha or standing-place for the village cattle. She
was rolled over the surface of the Kharkha about four times, again
rubbed with cowdung, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136"
name="pb136">136</a>]</span>another feast was given, and she slept the
night on the spot, without being washed. Next day, covered with the
dust and cowdung of the Kharkha, she crouched underneath the black
bullock&rsquo;s belly and in this manner proceeded to the gate of her
own yard. Here a bottle of liquor and fifteen chickens were waved round
her and afterwards offered at Devi&rsquo;s shrine, where they became
the property of the Panda who was conducting the ceremony. Another
feast was given in her yard and the woman slept there. Next day the
woman, after bathing, was placed standing with one foot outside her
threshold and the other inside; a feast was given, called the feast of
the threshold, and she again slept in her yard. On the following day
came the final feast of purification in the house. The woman was bathed
eleven times, and a hen, a chicken and five eggs were offered by the
Panda to each of her household gods. Then she drank a little liquor
from a cup of which the Panda had drunk, and ate some of the leavings
of food of which he had eaten. The black bullock and a piece of cloth
sufficient to cover it were presented to the Panda for his services.
Then the woman took a dish of rice and pulse and placed a little in the
leaf-cup of each of the caste-fellows present, and they all ate it and
she was readmitted to caste. Twelve cow-buffaloes were sold to pay for
the ceremony, which perhaps cost Rs. 600 or more.</p>

<h4 class="main">76. Dancing.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Dancing and singing to the dance constitute the social
amusement and recreation of the Gonds, and they are passionately fond
of it. The principal dance is the Karma, danced in celebration of the
bringing of the leafy branch of a tree from the forest in the rains.
They continue to dance it as a recreation during the nights of the cold
and hot weather, whenever they have leisure and a supply of liquor,
which is almost indispensable, is forthcoming. The M&#257;rias dance,
men and women together, in a great circle, each man holding the girl
next him on one side round the neck and on the other round the waist.
They keep perfect time, moving each foot alternately in unison
throughout the line, and moving round in a slow circle. Only unmarried
girls may join in a M&#257;ria dance, and once a woman is married she
can never dance again. This is no doubt a salutary provision
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>for household happiness, as sometimes couples,
excited by the dance and wine, run away from it into the jungle and
stay there for a day or two till their relatives bring them home and
consider them as married. At the M&#257;ria dances the men wear the
skins of tigers, panthers, deer and other animals, and sometimes
head-dresses of peacock&rsquo;s feathers. They may also have a girdle
of cowries round the waist, and a bell tied to their back to ring as
they move. The musicians sit in the centre and play various kinds of
drums and tom-toms. At a large M&#257;ria dance there may be as many as
thirty musicians, and the provision of rice or kodon and liquor may
cost as much as Rs. 50. In other localities the dance is less
picturesque. Men and women form two long lines opposite each other,
with the musicians in the centre, and advance and retreat alternately,
bringing one foot forward and the other up behind it, with a similar
movement in retiring. Married women may dance, and the men do not hold
the women at any time. At intervals they break off and liquor is
distributed in small leaf-cups, or if these are not available, it is
poured into the hands of the dancers held together like a cup. In
either case a considerable proportion of the liquor is usually spilt on
to the ground.</p>

unison, the men sometimes singing one line and the women the next, or
both together. The songs are with few exceptions of an erotic

<h4 class="main">78. Language.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In 1911 Gondi was spoken by 1,500,000 persons, or more
than half the total number of Gonds in India. The other Gonds of the
Central Provinces speak a broken Hindi. Gondi is a Dravidian language,
having a common ancestor with Tamil and Canarese, but little immediate
connection <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>with its neighbour Telugu; the specimens given
by Sir G. Grierson show that a large number of Hindi words have been
adopted into the vocabulary of Gondi, and this tendency is no doubt on
the increase. There are probably few Gonds outside the Feudatory
States, and possibly a few of the wildest tracts in British Districts,
who could not understand Hindi to some extent. And with the extension
of primary education in British Districts Gondi is likely to decline
still more rapidly. Gondi has no literature and no character of its
own; but the Gospels and the Book of Genesis have been translated into
it and several grammatical sketches and vocabularies compiled. In
Saugor the Hindus speak of Gondi as Farsi or Persian, apparently
applying this latter name to any foreign language.</p>

<h4 class="main">79. Cultivation.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gonds are mainly engaged in agriculture, and the
great bulk of them are farmservants and labourers. In the hilly tracts,
however, there is a substantial Gond tenantry, and a small number of
proprietors remain, though the majority have been ousted by Hindu
moneylenders and liquor-sellers. In the eastern Districts many
important zam&#299;nd&#257;ri estates are owned by Gond proprietors.
The ancestors of these families held the wild hilly country on the
borders of the plains in feudal tenure from the central rulers, and
were responsible for the restraint of the savage hillmen under their
jurisdiction, and the protection of the rich and settled lowlands from
predatory inroads from without. Their descendants are ordinary landed
proprietors, and would by this time have lost their estates but for the
protection of the law declaring them impartible and inalienable. A few
of the Feudatory Chiefs are also Gonds. Gond proprietors are generally
easy-going and kind-hearted to their tenants, but lacking in business
acumen and energy, and often addicted to drink and women. The tenants
are as a class shiftless and improvident and heavily indebted. But they
show signs of improvement, especially in the ryotw&#257;ri villages
under direct Government management, and it may be hoped that primary
education and more temperate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href=
"#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>habits will gradually render them
equal to the Hindu cultivators.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd21e5142">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">80. Patch cultivation.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Feudatory States and some of the
zam&#299;nd&#257;ris the Gonds retain the <i>dahia</i> or <i>bewar</i>
method of shifting cultivation, which has been prohibited everywhere
else on account of its destructive effects on the forests. The
M&#257;ria Gonds of Bastar cut down a patch of jungle on a hillside
about February, and on its drying up burn all the wood in April or May.
Tying strips of the bark of the <i>s&#257;j</i> tree to their feet to
prevent them from being burnt, they walk over the smouldering area, and
with long bamboo sticks move any unburnt logs into a burning patch, so
that they may all be consumed. When the first showers of rain fall they
scatter seed of the small millets into the soft covering of wood ashes,
and the fertility of the soil is such that without further trouble they
get a return of a hundred-fold or more. The same patch can be sown for
three years in succession without ploughing, but it then gives out, and
the Gonds move themselves and their habitations to a fresh one. When
the jungle has been allowed to grow on the old patch for ten or twelve
years, there is sufficient material for a fresh supply of wood-ash
manure, and they burn it over again. Teak yields a particularly
fertilising ash, and when standing the tree is hurtful to crops grown
near it, as its large, broad leaves cause a heavy drip and wash out the
grain. Hence the Gonds were particularly hostile to this tree, and it
is probably to their destructive efforts that the poor growth of teak
over large areas of the Provincial forests is due.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5156src" href="#xd21e5156" name="xd21e5156src">58</a> The
M&#257;ria Gonds do not use the plough, and their only agricultural
implement is a kind of hoe or spade. Elsewhere the Gonds are gradually
adopting the Hindu methods of cultivation, but their land is generally
in hilly and jungly tracts and of poor quality. They occupy large areas
of the wretched <i>barra</i> or gravel soil which has disintegrated
from the rock of the hillsides, and covers it in a thin sheet mixed
with quantities of large stones. The Gonds, however, like this land, as
it is so shallow as to entail very little trouble in ploughing, and it
is suitable for their favourite crops of the small millets, kodon and
kutki, and the poorer oilseeds. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141"
href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>After three years of cropping
it must be given an equal or longer period of fallow before it will
again yield any return. The Gonds say it is <i>n&#257;rang</i> or
exhausted. In the new ryotw&#257;ri villages formed within the last
twenty years the Gonds form a large section, and in Mandla the great
majority, of the tenantry, and have good black-soil fields which grow
wheat and other valuable crops. Here, perhaps, their condition is
happier than anywhere else, as they are secured in the possession of
their lands subject to the payment of revenue, liberally assisted with
Government loans at low interest, and protected as far as possible from
the petty extortion and peculation of Hindu subordinate officials and
moneylenders. The opening of a substantial number of primary schools to
serve these villages will, it may be hoped, have the effect of making
the Gond a more intelligent and provident cultivator, and counteract
the excessive addiction to liquor which is the great drawback to his
prosperity. The fondness of the Gond for his <i>b&#257;ri</i> or garden
plot adjoining his hut has been described in the section on villages
and houses.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">81. Hunting: traps for animals.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The primary occupation of the Gonds in former times
was hunting and fishing, but their opportunities in this respect have
been greatly circumscribed by the conservation of the game in
Government forests, which was essential if it was not to become
extinct, when the native <i>shik&#257;ris</i> had obtained firearms.
Their weapons were until recently bows and arrows, but now Gond hunters
usually have an old matchlock gun. They have several ingenious devices
for trapping animals. It is essential for them to make a stockade round
their patch cultivation fields in the forests, or the grain would be
devoured by pig and deer. At one point in this they leave a narrow
opening, and in front of it dig a deep pit and cover it with brushwood
and grass; then at the main entrance they spread some sand. Coming in
the middle of the night they see from the footprints in the sand what
animals have entered the enclosure; if these are worth catching they
close the main gate, and make as much noise as they can. The frightened
animals dash round the enclosure and, seeing the opening, run through
it and fall into the pit, where they are easily despatched with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>clubs and axes. They also set traps across the
forest paths frequented by animals. The method is to take a strong
raw-hide rope and secure one end of it to a stout sapling, which is
bent down like a spring. The other end is made into a noose and laid
open on the ground, often over a small hole. It is secured by a stone
or log of wood, and this is so arranged by means of some kind of
fall-trap that on pressure in the centre of the hole it is displaced
and releases the noose. The animal comes and puts his foot in the hole,
thus removing the trap which secured the noose. This flies up and takes
the animal&rsquo;s foot with it, being drawn tight in mid-air by the
rebound of the sapling. The animal is thus suspended with one foot in
the air, which it cannot free, and the Gonds come and kill it. Tigers
are sometimes caught in this manner. A third very cruel kind of trap is
made by putting up a hedge of thorns and grass across a forest-path, on
the farther side of which they plant a few strong and sharply-pointed
bamboo stakes. A deer coming up will jump the hedge, and on landing
will be impaled on one of the stakes. The wound is very severe and
often festers immediately, so that the victim dies in a few hours. Or
they suspend a heavy beam over a forest path held erect by a loose prop
which stands on the path. The deer comes along and knocks aside the
prop, and the beam falls on him and pins him down. Mr. Montgomerie
writes as follows on Gond methods of hunting:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5184src" href="#xd21e5184" name="xd21e5184src">59</a> &ldquo;The
use of the bow and arrow is being forgotten owing to the restrictions
placed by Government on hunting. The Gonds can still throw an axe
fairly straight, but a running hare is a difficult mark and has a good
chance of escaping. The hare, however, falls a victim to the
fascination of fire. The Gond takes an earthen pot, knocks a large hole
in the side of it, and slings it on a pole with a counterbalancing
stone at the other end. Then at night he slings the pole over one
shoulder, with the earthen pot in front containing fire, and sallies
out hare-hunting. He is accompanied by a man who bears a bamboo. The
hare, attracted and fascinated by the light, comes close and watches it
stupidly till the bamboo descends on the animal&rsquo;s head, and the
Gonds have hare for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143"
name="pb143">143</a>]</span>supper.&rdquo; Sometimes a bell is rung as
well, and this is said to attract the animals. They also catch fish by
holding a lamp over the water on a dark night and spearing them with a
trident.</p>

small hybrid caste formed from alliances between Gonds and Gow&#257;ris
or herdsmen of the Mar&#257;tha country. Though they must now be
considered as a distinct caste, being impure and thus ranking lower
than either the Gonds or Gow&#257;ris, they are still often identified
with either of them. In 1901 only 3000 were returned, principally from
the N&#257;gpur and Ch&#257;nda Districts. In 1911 they were
amalgamated with the Gow&#257;ris, and this view may be accepted as
their origin is the same. The Gow&#257;ris say that the
Gond-Gow&#257;ris are the descendants of one of two brothers who
accidentally ate the flesh of a cow. Both the Gonds and Gow&#257;ris
frequent the jungles for long periods together, and it is natural that
intimacies should spring up between the youth of either sex. And the
progeny of these irregular connections has formed a separate caste,
looked down upon by both its progenitors. The Gond-Gow&#257;ris have no
subcastes, and for purposes of marriages are divided into exogamous
septs, all bearing Gond names. Like the Gonds, the caste is also split
into two divisions, worshipping six and seven gods respectively, and
members of septs worshipping the same number of gods must not marry
with each other. The deities of the six and seven god-worshippers are
identical, except that the latter have one extra called Durga or Devi,
who is represented by a copper coin of the old N&#257;gpur dynasty. Of
the other deities B&#363;ra Deo is a piece of iron, Khoda and
Khod&#257;van are both pieces of the <i>kadamb</i> tree (<i>Nauclea
parvifolia</i>), Sup&#257;ri is the areca-nut, and Kaipen consists of
two iron rings and counts as two deities. It seems probable, therefore,
from the double set of identical deities that two of the original ones
have been forgotten. The gods are kept on a small piece of red cloth in
a closed bamboo basket, which must not be opened except on days of
worship, lest they should work some mischief; on these special days
they are rendered harmless <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>for the time being by the homage
which is rendered to them. Marriage is adult, and a bride-price of nine
rupees and some grain is commonly paid by the boy&rsquo;s family. The
ceremony is a mixture of Gond and Mar&#257;tha forms; the couple walk
seven times round a <i>bohla</i> or mound of earth and the guests clap
their hands. At a widow-marriage they walk three and a half times round
a burning lamp, as this is considered to be only a kind of
half-marriage. The morality of the caste is very loose, and a wife will
commonly be pardoned any transgression except an intrigue with a man of
very low caste. Women of other castes, such as Kunbis or Barhais, may
be admitted to the community on forming a connection with a
Gond-Gow&#257;ri. The caste have no prescribed observance of mourning
for the dead. The Gond-Gow&#257;ris are cultivators and labourers, and
dress like the Kunbis. They are considered to be impure and must live
outside the village, while other castes refuse to touch them. The
bodies of the women are disfigured by excessive tattooing, the legs
being covered with a pattern of dots and lines reaching up to the
thighs. In this matter they simply follow their Gond ancestors, but
they say that a woman who is not tattooed is impure and cannot worship
the deities.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Gondhali.</b><a class="noteref" id="xd21e5221src"
href="#xd21e5221" name="xd21e5221src">1</a>&mdash;A caste or order of
wandering beggars and musicians found in the Mar&#257;tha Districts of
the Central Provinces and in Ber&#257;r. The name is derived from the
Mar&#257;thi word <i>gondharne</i>, to make a noise. In 1911 the
Gondhalis numbered about 3000 persons in Ber&#257;r and 500 in the
Central Provinces, and they are also found in Bombay. The origin of the
caste is obscure, but it appears to have been recruited in recent times
from the offspring of W&#257;ghyas and Murlis or male and female
children devoted to temples by their parents in fulfilment of a vow.
Mr. Kitts states in the <i>Ber&#257;r Census Report</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5229src" href="#xd21e5229" name="xd21e5229src">2</a>
of 1881 that the Gondhalis are there attached either to the temple of
Tukai at Tulj&#257;pur or the temple of Renuka at M&#257;hur, and in
consequence form two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145"
name="pb145">145</a>]</span>subcastes, the Kadamrai and Renurai, who do
not intermarry. In the Central Provinces, however, besides these two
there are a number of other subcastes, most of which bear the names of
distinct castes, and obviously consist of members of that caste who
became Gondhalis, or of their descendants. Thus among the names of
subcastes reported are the Br&#257;hman, Mar&#257;tha, M&#257;ne Kunbi,
Khaire Kunbi, Teli, Mah&#257;r, M&#257;ng and Vid&#363;r Gondhalis, as
well as others like the Deshkars, or those coming from the Deccan, the
Gang&#257;p&#257;re,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5234src" href=
"#xd21e5234" name="xd21e5234src">3</a> or those from beyond the Ganges,
and the Hijade or eunuchs. It is clear, therefore, that members of
these castes becoming Gondhalis attempt to arrange their marriages with
other converts from their own caste and to retain their relative social
position. There is little doubt that all Gondhalis are theoretically
meant to be equal, a principle which at their first foundation applies
to nearly all sects and orders, but here as elsewhere the social
feeling of caste has been too strong to permit of its retention. It may
be doubted, however, whether in view of the small total numbers of the
caste all these groups can be strictly endogamous. The Kunbi Gondhalis
can take food from the ordinary Kunbis, but they rank below them, as
being mendicants. The caste has also a number of exogamous groups or
<i>gotras</i>, the names of which may be classified as titular or
territorial. Instances of the former kind are Dokiphode or one who
broke his head while begging, Sukt (thin, emaciated), Muke (dumb),
Jabal (one with long hair like a Jog&#299;), and Panch&#257;nge (one
who has five limbs). Girls are married as a rule before adolescence,
and the ceremony resembles that of the Kunbis, but a special prayer is
offered to the deity Renuka, and the boy is invested with a necklace of
cowries by five married men of the caste. Till this has been done he is
not considered to be a proper Gondhali. Celibacy is not a tenet of the
order. The remarriage of widows is allowed, and the ceremony consists
in the husband placing a string of small black glass beads round the
woman&rsquo;s neck, while she holds out a pair of new shoes for him to
put his feet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>into. The second wife often wears a small silver
or golden image of the first wife round her neck, and worships it
before she eats by touching it with food; she also asks its permission
before going to sleep with her husband. The goddess Bhaw&#257;ni or
Devi is especially revered by the caste, and they fast in her honour on
Tuesdays and Fridays. They worship their musical instruments at Dasahra
with an offering of a goat, and afterwards sing and dance for the whole
night, this being their principal festival. They also observe the nine
days&rsquo; fasts in honour of Devi in Chait (March) and Kunw&#257;r
(September) and sow the Jawaras or pots of wheat. The Gondhalis are
mendicant musicians, and are engaged on the occasion of marriages among
the higher castes to perform their <i>gondhal</i> or dance accompanied
by music. Four men are needed for it, one being the dancer who is
dressed in a long white robe with a necklace of cowries and bells on
his ankles, while the other three stand behind him, two of them
carrying drums and the third a sacred torch called <i>dioti</i>. The
torch-bearer serves as a butt for the witticisms of the dancer. Their
instruments are the <i>chonka</i>, an open drum carrying an iron string
which is beaten with a small wooden pin, and two <i>sambals</i> or
double drums of iron, wood or earth, one of which emits a dull and the
other a sharp sound. The dance is performed in honour of the goddess
Bhaw&#257;ni. They set up a wooden stool on the stage arranged for the
performance, covered with a cloth on which wheat is spread, and over
this is placed a brass vessel containing water and a cocoanut. This
represents the goddess. After the performance the Gondhalis take away
and eat the cocoanut and wheat; their regular fee for an engagement is
Rs. 1&ndash;4, and the guests give them presents of a few pice
(farthings). They are engaged for important ceremonies such as
marriages, the B&#257;rsa or name-giving of a boy, and the Shantik or
maturity of a girl, and also merely for entertainment; but in this case
the stool and cocoanut representing the goddess are not set up. The
following is a specimen of a Gondhali religious song:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Where I come from and who am I,</p>
<p class="line">This mystery none has solved;</p>
<p class="line">Father, mother, sister and brother, these are all
illusions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">I call them mine and am lost in my selfish
concerns.</p>
<p class="line">Worldliness is the beginning of hell, man has wrapped
himself in it without reason.</p>
<p class="line">Remember your <i>guru</i>, go to him and touch his
feet.</p>
<p class="line">Put on the shield of mercy and compassion and take the
sword of knowledge.</p>
<p class="line">God is in every human body.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The caste beg between dawn and noon, wearing a long
white or red robe and a red turban folded from twisted strings of cloth
like the Mar&#257;thas. Their status is somewhat low, but they are
usually simple and honest. Occasionally a man becomes a Gondhali in
fulfilment of a vow without leaving his own caste; he will then be
initiated by a member of the caste and given the necklace of cowries,
and on every Tuesday he will wear this and beg from five persons in
honour of the goddess Devi; while except for this observance he remains
a member of his own caste and pursues his ordinary business.</p>

Major Gunthorpe&rsquo;s <i>Criminal Tribes</i>; Mr. Kitt&rsquo;s
<i>Ber&#257;r Census Report</i>, 1881.</p>
<p>A small vagrant and criminal caste of Ber&#257;r, where they
numbered about 2000 persons in 1901. In the Central Provinces they were
included among the Nats in 1901, but in 1891 a total of 681 were
returned. Here they belong principally to the Nim&#257;r District, and
Major Gunthorpe considers that they entered Ber&#257;r from Nim&#257;r
and Indore.</p>
<p>They are divided into five classes, the Mar&#257;thi, V&#299;r,
Pangul, Pahalw&#257;n, or Kh&#257;m, and Gujar&#257;ti Gop&#257;ls. The
ostensible occupation of all the groups is the buying and selling of
buffaloes. The word Gop&#257;l means a cowherd and is a name of
Krishna. The Mar&#257;thi Gop&#257;ls rank higher than the rest, and
all other classes will take food from them, while the V&#299;r
Gop&#257;ls eat the flesh of dead cattle and are looked down upon by
the others. The ostensible occupation of the V&#299;r Gop&#257;ls is
that of making mats from the leaves of the date-palm tree. They build
their huts of date-leaves outside a village and remain there for one or
two years or more until the headman tells them to move on. The name
Borekar is stated to have the meaning of mat-maker. The P&#257;ngul
Gop&#257;ls also make mats, but in addition to this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>they
are mendicants, begging from off trees, and must be the same as the
Harbola mendicants of the Central Provinces. The P&#257;ngul spreads a
cloth below a tree and climbing it sits on some high branch in the
early morning. Here he sings and chants the praises of charitable
persons until somebody throws a small present on to the cloth. This he
does only between cock-crow and sunrise and not after sunrise. Others
walk through the streets, ejaculating <i>dam!</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5302src" href="#xd21e5302" name="xd21e5302src">1</a> <i>dam!</i>
and begging from door to door. With the exception of shaving after a
death they never cut the hair either of their head or face. Their
principal deity is D&#257;wal M&#257;lik, but they also worship
Khandoba; and they bury the bodies of their dead. The corpse is carried
to the grave in a <i>jholi</i> or wallet and is buried in a sitting
posture. In order to discover whether a dead ancestor has been reborn
in a child they have recourse to magic. A lamp is suspended from a
thread, and the upper stone of the grinding-mill is placed standing
upon the lower one. If either of them moves when the name of the dead
ancestor is pronounced they consider that he has been reborn. One
section of the P&#257;nguls has taken to agriculture, and these refuse
to marry with the mendicants, though eating and drinking with them. The
Pahalw&#257;n Gop&#257;ls live in small tents and travel about,
carrying their belongings on buffaloes. They are wrestlers and
gymnasts, and belong mainly to Hyder&#257;b&#257;d.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5313src" href="#xd21e5313" name="xd21e5313src">2</a> The
Kh&#257;m Gop&#257;ls are a similar group also belonging to
Hyder&#257;b&#257;d; and are so named because they carry about a long
pole (<i>kh&#257;m</i>) on which they perform acrobatic feats. They
also have thick canvas bags, striped blue and white, in which they
carry their property. The Gujar&#257;ti Gop&#257;ls are lower than the
other divisions, who will not take food from them. They are tumblers
and do feats of strength and also perform on the tight-rope. All five
groups, Major Gunthorpe states, are inveterate cattle-thieves; and have
colonies of their people settled on the Indore and Hyder&#257;b&#257;d
borders and between them along the foot of the Satp&#363;ra Hills.
Buffaloes or other animals which they steal are passed along from post
to post and taken to foreign territory in an incredibly short space of
time. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>considerable proportion of them, however, have
now taken to agriculture, and their proper traditional calling is to
sell milk and butter, for which they keep buffaloes. Gop&#257;l is a
name of Krishna, and they consider themselves to be descended from the
herdsmen of Brind&#257;ban. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href=

<h3 class="main">1. Names for the Gosains.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Gosain</b>, <b>Gusain</b>, <b>Sanni&#257;si</b>,
<b>Dasn&#257;mi</b>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5413src" href=
"#xd21e5413" name="xd21e5413src">1</a>&mdash;A name for the orders of
religious mendicants of the Sivite sect, from which a caste has now
developed. In 1911 the Gosains numbered a little over 40,000 persons in
the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r, being distributed over all
Districts. The name Gosain signifies either <i>gao-sw&#257;mi</i>,
master of cows, or <i>go-sw&#257;mi</i>, master of the senses. Its
significance sometimes varies. Thus in Bengal the heads of Bair&#257;gi
or Vaishnava monasteries are called Gosain, and the priests of the
Vishnuite Vallabhach&#257;rya sect are known as Gokulastha Gosain. But
over most of India, as in the Central Provinces, Gosain appears to be a
name applied to members of the Sivite orders. Sanni&#257;si means one
who abandons the desires of the world and the body. Properly every
Br&#257;hman should become a Sanni&#257;si in the fourth stage or
<i>ashr&#257;m</i> of his life, when after marrying and begetting a son
to celebrate his funeral rites in the second stage, he should retire to
the forest, become a hermit and conquer all the appetites and passions
of the body in the third stage. Thereafter, when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>the
process of mortification is complete he should beg his bread as a
Sanni&#257;si. But only those who enter the religious orders now become
Sanni&#257;sis, and the name is therefore confined to them.
Dasn&#257;mi means the ten names, and refers to the ten orders in which
the Gosains or Sivite anchorites are commonly classified. S&#257;dhu is
a generic term for a religious mendicant. The name Gosain is now more
commonly applied to the married members of the caste, who pursue
ordinary avocations, while the mendicants are known as S&#257;dhu or
Sanni&#257;si.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">2. The ten orders.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gosains consider their founder to have been
Shankar Ach&#257;rya, the great apostle of the revival of the worship
of Siva in southern India, who lived between the eighth and tenth
centuries. He had four disciples from whom the ten orders of Gosains
are derived. These are commonly stated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Giri (peak or top of a hill).</li>
<li>2. Puri (a town).</li>
<li>3. Parbat (a mountain).</li>
<li>4. S&#257;gar (the ocean).</li>
<li>5. Ban or Van (the forest).</li>
<li>6. T&#299;rtha (a shrine of pilgrimage).</li>
<li>7. Bh&#257;rthi (the goddess of speech).</li>
<li>8. S&#257;raswati (the goddess of learning).</li>
<li>9. Aranya (forest).</li>
<li>10. Ashr&#257;m (a hermitage).</li>
</ul>
<p>The names may perhaps be held to refer to the different places in
which the members of each order would pursue their austerities. The
different orders have their headquarters at great shrines. The
S&#257;raswati, Bh&#257;rthi and Puri orders are supposed to be
attached to the monastery at Sringeri in Mysore; the T&#299;rtha and
Ashr&#257;m to that at Dw&#257;rka in Gujar&#257;t; the Ban and Aranya
to the Govardhan monastery at Puri; and the Giri, Parbat and
S&#257;gara to the shrine of Badrin&#257;th in the Himalayas.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Alakhw&#257;le Gosains with faces covered with

</div>
<p>Dandi is sometimes shown as one of the ten orders, but it seems to
be the special designation of certain ascetics who carry a staff and
may belong to either the T&#299;rtha, Ashr&#257;m, Bh&#257;rthi or
S&#257;raswati groups. Another name for Gosain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>ascetics is Abdh&#363;t, or one who has
separated himself from the world. The term Abdh&#363;t is sometimes
specially applied to followers of the Mar&#257;tha saint, Dattatreya,
an incarnation of Siva.</p>
<p>The commonest orders in the Central Provinces are Giri, Puri and
Bh&#257;rthi, and the members frequently use the name of the order as
their surname. Members of the Aranya, S&#257;gara and Parbat orders are
rarely met with at present.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">3. Initiation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A notice of the Gosains who have become an ordinary
caste will be given later. Formerly only Br&#257;hmans or members of
the twice-born castes could become Gosains, but now a man of any caste,
as Kurmi, Kunbi or M&#257;li, from whom a Br&#257;hman takes water, may
be admitted. In some localities it is said that Gonds and Kols can now
be made Gosains, and hence the social position of the Gosains has
greatly fallen, and high-caste Hindus will not take water from them. It
is supposed, however, that the Giri order is still recruited only from
Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>At initiation the body of a neophyte is cleaned with the five
products of the sacred cow, milk, curds, <i>gh&#299;</i>, dung and
urine. He drinks water in which the great toe of his <i>guru</i> has
been dipped and eats the leavings of the latter&rsquo;s food, thus
severing himself from his own caste. His sacred thread is taken off and
broken, and it is sometimes burned and he eats the ashes. All the hair
of his head is shaved, including the scalp-lock, which every secular
Hindu wears. A <i>mantra</i> or text is then whispered or blown into
his ear.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd21e5498" class="div2 section"><span class=
"pagenum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">4. Dress.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The novice is dressed in a cloth coloured with
<i>geru</i> or red ochre, such as the Gosains usually wear. It is
probable that the red or pink colour is meant to symbolise blood and to
signify that the Gosains allow the sacrifice of animals and the
consumption of flesh, and on this account they are called L&#257;l
P&#257;dri or red priest, while Vishnuite mendicants, who dress in
white, are called S&#299;ta P&#257;dri. He has a necklace or rosary of
the seeds of the <i><span class="corr" id="xd21e5507" title=
"Source: rudr&#257;khsa">rudr&#257;ksha</span></i> tree,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5510src" href="#xd21e5510" name="xd21e5510src">2</a>
sacred to Siva, consisting of 32 or 64 beads. These are like nuts with
a rough indented shell. On his forehead he marks with
<i>bhabh&#363;t</i> or ashes three horizontal lines to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>represent the trident of Siva, or sometimes the
eye of the god. Others make only two lines with a dot above or below,
and this sign is said to represent the phallic emblem. A crescent moon
or a triangle may also be made.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5520src"
href="#xd21e5520" name="xd21e5520src">3</a> The marks are often made in
sandalwood, and the Gosains say that the original sandalwood grows on a
tree in the Himalayas, which is guarded by a great snake so that nobody
can approach it; but its scent is so strong that all the surrounding
trees of the grove are scented with it and sandalwood is obtained from
them. Those who worship Bhairon make a round mark with vermilion
between the eyes, taking it from beneath the god&rsquo;s foot. A
mendicant usually has a begging-bowl and a pair of tongs, which are
useful for kindling a fire. Those who have visited Badrin&#257;th or
one of the other Himalayan shrines have a ring of iron, brass or copper
on the arm, often inscribed with the image of a deity. If they have
been to the temple of Devi at Hingl&#257;j in the L&#257;sbela State of
Beluchist&#257;n they have a necklace of little white stone beads
called <i>thumra</i>; and one who has made a pilgrimage to
R&#257;meshwaram at the extreme southern point of India has a ring of
conch-shell on the wrist. When he can obtain it a Gosain also carries a
tiger- or panther-skin, which he wears over his shoulders and uses to
sit and lie down on. Among the ancient Greeks it was the custom to
sleep in a temple or its avenue either on the bare ground or on the
skin of a sacred animal, in order to obtain visions or appearances of
the god in a dream or to be cured of diseases.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5529src" href="#xd21e5529" name="xd21e5529src">4</a> Formerly the
Gosains were accustomed to go about naked, and at the religious
festivals they would go in procession naked to bathe in the river. At
Amarn&#257;th in the Punjab they would throw themselves naked on the
block of ice which represented Siva.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5534src" href="#xd21e5534" name="xd21e5534src">5</a> The
N&#257;ga Gosains, so called because they were once accustomed to go
naked into battle, were a famous fighting corps. Though they shave the
head and scalp-lock on initiation the Gosains usually let the hair
grow, and either have it hanging down <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>in matted locks over
the shoulders, which gives them a wild and unkempt appearance, or wind
it on the top of the head into a coil often thickened with strips of
sheep&rsquo;s wool. They say that they let the hair grow in imitation
of the ancient forest ascetics, who could not but let it grow as they
had no means to shave it, and also of the matted locks of the god Siva.
Sometimes they let the hair grow during the whole period of a
pilgrimage, and on arrival at the shrine of their destination shave it
off and offer it to the god. Those who are initiated on the banks of
the Nerbudda throw the hair cut from their head into the sacred
river.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Methods of begging and greetings.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They have various rules about begging. Some will never
turn back to receive alms. They may also make a rule only to accept the
surplus of food cooked for the family, and to refuse any of special
quality or cooked expressly for them. One Gosain, noticed by Mr. A. K.
Smith, always begged hopping, and only from five houses; he took from
them respectively two handfuls of flour, a pinch of salt, and
sufficient quantities of vegetables, spices and butter for his meal,
and then went hopping home. Those who are performing the
<i>perikrama</i> or circuit of the Nerbudda from its source to its
mouth and back, do not cut their hair or nails during the whole period
of about three years. They may not enter the Nerbudda above their knees
nor wash their vessels in it. After crossing any tributary river or
stream in their path they may not re-cross this; and if they have
forgotten or left any article behind, must abandon it unless they can
persuade somebody to go back and fetch it for them. Some carry a gourd
with a single string stretched on a stick, on which they twang some
notes; others have a belt of sheep&rsquo;s hair hung with the bells of
bullocks which they tie round the waist, so that the tinkling of the
bells may announce their coming. A common begging cry is Alakh, which
is said to mean &lsquo;apart,&rsquo; and to refer to themselves as
being apart or separated from the world. The beggar gives this cry and
stands at the door of the house for half a minute, shaking his body
about all the time. If no alms are brought in this time he moves
on.</p>
<p>When an ordinary Hindu meets a Gosain he says &lsquo;N&#257;mu
N&#257;r&#257;yan&rsquo; or &lsquo;I go to N&#257;r&#257;yan,&rsquo;
and the Gosain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>answers &lsquo;N&#257;r&#257;yan.&rsquo;
N&#257;r&#257;yan is a name of Vishnu, and its use by the Gosains is
curious. Those who have performed the circuit of the Nerbudda say
&lsquo;Har Nerbudda,&rsquo; and the person addressed answers
&lsquo;Nerbudda Mai ki Jai&rsquo; or &lsquo;Victory to Mother
Nerbudda.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">6. The Dandis.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Dandis are a special group of ascetics belonging
to several of the ten orders. According to one account a novice who
desires to become a Sanni&#257;si must serve a period of probation for
twelve years as a Dandi. Others say that only a Br&#257;hman can be a
Dandi, while members of other castes may become Sanni&#257;sis, and a
Br&#257;hman can only become one if he is without father, mother, wife
or child.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5564src" href="#xd21e5564" name=
"xd21e5564src">6</a> The Dandi is so called because he has a
<i>dand</i> or bamboo staff like the ancient Vedic students. He must
always carry this and never lay it down, but when sleeping plant it in
the ground. Sometimes a piece of red cloth is tied round the staff. The
Dandi should live in the forest, and only come once a day to beg at a
Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s house for a part of such food as the family may
have cooked. He should not ask for food if any one else, even a dog, is
waiting for it. He must not accept money, or touch fire or any metal.
As a matter of fact these rules are disregarded, and the Dandi
frequents towns and is accompanied by companions who will accept all
kinds of alms on his behalf.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5573src" href=
"#xd21e5573" name="xd21e5573src">7</a> Dandis and Sanni&#257;sis do not
worship idols, as they are themselves considered to have become part of
the deity. They repeat the phrase &lsquo;Sevoham,&rsquo; which
signifies &lsquo;I am Siva.&rsquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">7. The R&#257;wanvansis.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another curious class of Gosains are the
R&#257;wanvansis, who go about in the character of R&#257;wan, the
demon king of Ceylon, as he was when he carried off S&#299;ta. The
legend is that in order to do this, R&#257;wan first sent his brother
in the shape of a golden deer before R&#257;ma&rsquo;s palace.
S&#299;ta saw it and said she must have the head of the deer, and sent
R&#257;ma to kill it. So R&#257;ma pursued it to the forest, and from
there R&#257;wan cried out, imitating R&#257;ma&rsquo;s voice. Then
S&#299;ta thought R&#257;ma was being attacked and told his brother
Lachman to go to his help. But Lachman had been left <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>in
charge of her by R&#257;ma and refused to leave her, till S&#299;ta
said he was hoping R&#257;ma would be killed, so that he might marry
her. Then he drew a circle round her on the ground, and telling her not
to step outside it until his return, went off. Then R&#257;wan took the
disguise of a beggar and came and begged for alms from S&#299;ta. She
told him to come inside the magic circle and she would give him alms,
but he refused. So finally S&#299;ta came outside the circle, and
R&#257;wan at once seized her and carried her off to Ceylon. The
R&#257;wanvansi Gosains wear rings of hair all up their arms and a rope
of hair round the waist, and the hair of their head hanging down. It
would appear that they are intended to represent some animal. They
smear vermilion on the forehead, and beg only at twilight and never at
any other time, whether they obtain food or not. In begging they will
never move backwards, so that when they have passed a house they cannot
take alms from it unless the householder brings the gift to them.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Unmarried Sanni&#257;sis often reside in Maths or
monasteries. The superior is called Mahant, and he appoints his
successor by will from the members. The Mahant admits all those willing
and qualified to enter the order. If the applicant is young the consent
of the parents is usually obtained; and parents frequently vow to give
a child to the order. Many convents have considerable areas of land
attached to them, and also dependent institutions. The whole property
of the convent and its dependencies seems to be at the absolute
disposal of the Mahant, but he is bound to give food, raiment and
lodging to the inmates, and he entertains all travellers belonging to
the order.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5599src" href="#xd21e5599" name=

<h3 class="main">9. The fighting Gosains.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In former times the Gosains often became soldiers and
entered the service of different military chiefs. The most famous of
these fighting priests were the N&#257;ga Gosains of the Jaipur State
of R&#257;jput&#257;na, who are said to have been under an obligation
from their <i>guru</i> or religious chief to fight for the R&#257;ja of
Jaipur whenever required. They received rent-free lands and pay of two
pice (&frac12;d.) a day, which latter was put into a common treasury
and expended on the purchase of arms and ammunition whenever needed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>for war. They would also lend money, and if a
debtor could not pay would make him give his son to be enrolled in the
force. The 7000 N&#257;ga Gosains were placed in the vanguard of the
Jaipur army in battle. Their weapons were the bow, arrow, shield, spear
and discus. The Gosain proprietor of the Deopur estate in Raipur
formerly kept up a force of N&#257;ga Gosains, with which he used to
collect the tribute from the feudatory chiefs of Chhatt&#299;sgarh on
behalf of the R&#257;ja of N&#257;gpur. It is said that he once invaded
Bastar with this object, where most of the Gosains died of cholera. But
after they had fasted for three days, the goddess Danteshwari appeared
to them and promised them her protection. And they took the goddess
away with them and installed her in their own village in Raipur. Forbes
records that in Gujar&#257;t an English officer was in command of a
troop known as the Gosain&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s troops. These N&#257;ga
Gosains wore only a single white garment, like a sleeveless shirt
reaching to the knees, and hence it is said that they were called
naked. The Gosains and Bair&#257;gis, or adherents of Siva and Vishnu,
were often engaged in religious quarrels on the merits of their
respective deities, and sometimes came to blows. A favourite point of
rivalry was the right of bathing first in the Ganges on the occasion of
one of the great religious fairs at Allah&#257;b&#257;d or
Hardw&#257;r. The Gosains claim priority of bathing, on the ground that
the Ganges flows from the matted locks of Siva; while the Bair&#257;gis
assert that the source of the river is from Vishnu&rsquo;s foot. In
1760 a pitched battle on this question ended in the defeat of the
Bair&#257;gis, of whom 1800 were slain. Again in 1796 the Gosains
engaged in battle with the Sikh pilgrims and were defeated with the
loss of 500 men.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5615src" href="#xd21e5615"
name="xd21e5615src">9</a> During the reign of Akbar a combat took place
in the Emperor&rsquo;s presence between the two Sivite sects of
Gosains, or Sanni&#257;sis and Jogis, having been apparently arranged
for his edification, to decide which sect had the best ground for its
pretensions to supernatural power. The Jogis were completely
defeated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5621src" href="#xd21e5621" name=

<h3 class="main">10. Burial.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A dead Sanni&#257;si is always buried in the sitting
attitude of religious contemplation with the legs crossed. The grave
may be dug with a side receptacle for the corpse so that the earth, on
being filled in, does not fall on it. The corpse is bathed and rubbed
with ashes and clad in a new reddish-coloured shirt, with a rosary
round the neck. The begging-wallet with some flour and pulse are placed
in the grave, and also a gourd and staff. Salt is put round the body to
preserve it, and an earthen pot is put over the head. Sometimes
cocoanuts are broken on the skull, to crack it and give exit to the
soul. Perhaps the idea of burial and of preserving the corpse with salt
is that the body of an ascetic does not need to be purified by fire
from the appetites and passions of the flesh like that of an ordinary
Hindu; it is already cleansed of all earthly frailty by his
austerities, and the belief may therefore have originally been that
such a man would carry his body with him to the afterworld or to
absorption with the deity. The burial of a Sanni&#257;si is often
accompanied with music and signs of rejoicing; Mr. Oman describes such
a funeral in which the corpse was seated in a litter, open on three
sides so that it could be seen; it was tied to the back of the litter,
and garlands of flowers partly covered the body, but could not conceal
the hideousness of death as the unconscious head rolled helplessly from
side to side with the movement of the litter. The procession was headed
by a European brass band and by men carrying censers of
incense.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5635src" href="#xd21e5635" name=

outside the large section of the community which now recognises
marriage. Women could be admitted into the order, when they had to
shave their heads, assume the ochre-coloured shirt and rub their bodies
with ashes. Afterwards, with the permission of the <i>guru</i> and on
payment of a fine, they could let their hair grow again, at least
temporarily. These women were supposed to remain quite chaste and live
in nunneries, but many of them lived with men of the order. It is not
known to what extent women are admitted at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>present. The sons born of such unions would be
adopted as <i>chelas</i> or disciples by other Gosains, and made their
heirs by a reciprocal arrangement. Women who are convicted of some
social offence, or who wish to leave their husbands, often join the
order nominally and live with a Gosain or are married into the caste.
Many of the wandering mendicants lead an immoral life, and scandals
about their enticing away the wives of rich Hindus are not
infrequent.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5656src" href="#xd21e5656" name=
"xd21e5656src">12</a> During their visits to villages they also engage
in intrigues, and a ribald Gond song sung at the Holi festival
describes the pleasure of the village women at the arrival of a Gosain
owing to the sexual gratification which they expected to receive from
him.</p>

<p class="first">Nevertheless the wandering Gosains have done much to
foster and maintain the Hindu religion among the people. They are the
<i>gurus</i> or spiritual preceptors of the middle and lower castes,
and though their teaching may be of little advantage, it perhaps
quickens and maintains to some extent the religious feelings of their
clients. In former times the Gosains travelled over the wildest tracts
of country, proselytising the primitive non-Aryan tribes, for whose
conversion to Hinduism they are largely responsible. On such journeys
they necessarily carried their lives in their hands, and not
infrequently lost them.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The majority of the Gosains are, however, now married
and form an ordinary caste. Buchanan states that the ten different
orders became exogamous groups, the members of which married with each
other, but it is doubtful whether this is the case at present. It is
said that all Giri Gosains marry, whether they are mendicants or not,
while the Bh&#257;rthi order can marry or not as they please. They
prohibit any marriage between first cousins, but permit widow
remarriage and divorce. They eat the flesh of all clean animals and
also of fowls, and drink liquor, and will take cooked food from the
higher castes, including Sun&#257;rs and Kunbis. Hence they do not rank
high socially, and Br&#257;hmans do not take water from them, but their
religious character gives them some prestige. Many Gosains have become
landholders, obtaining their estates either as charitable grants from
clients or through moneylending transactions. In this capacity they do
not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=

<p class="first"><b>Gow&#257;ri.</b><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5686src" href="#xd21e5686" name="xd21e5686src">1</a>&mdash;The
herdsman or grazier caste of the Mar&#257;tha country, corresponding to
the Ah&#299;rs or Gaolis. The name is derived from <i>gai</i> or
<i>gao</i>, the cow, and means a cowherd. The Gow&#257;ris numbered
more than 150,000 persons in 1911, of whom nearly 120,000 belonged to
the N&#257;gpur division and nearly 30,000 to Ber&#257;r. In localities
where the Gow&#257;ris predominate, Ah&#299;rs or Gaolis, the regular
herdsman caste, are found only in small numbers. The honorific title of
the Gow&#257;ris is Dhare, which is said to mean &lsquo;One who keeps
cattle.&rsquo; The Gow&#257;ris rank distinctly below the Ah&#299;rs or
Gaolis. The legend of their origin is that an Ah&#299;r, who was
tending the cows of Krishna, stood in need of a helper. He found a
small boy in the forest and took him home and brought him up. He then
gave to the boy the work of grazing cows in the jungle, while he
himself stayed at home and made milk and butter. This boy was the
ancestor of the Gow&#257;ri caste. His descendants took to eating fowls
and peacocks and drinking liquor, and hence were degraded below the
Gaolis. But the latter will allow Gow&#257;ris to sit at their feasts
and eat, they will carry the corpse of a Gow&#257;ri to the grave, and
they will act as members of the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> in readmitting a
Gow&#257;ri who has been put out of caste. In the Mar&#257;tha country
any man who touches the corpse of a man of another caste is temporarily
excommunicated, and the fact that a Gaoli will do this for a
Gow&#257;ri demonstrates the close relationship of the castes. The
legend, in fact, indicates quite clearly and correctly the origin of
the Gow&#257;ris. The small boy in the forest was a Gond, and the
Gow&#257;ri caste is of mixed descent from Ah&#299;rs and Gonds. The
Ah&#299;rs or Gaolis of the Mar&#257;tha country have largely abandoned
the work of grazing cattle in the forest, and have taken to the more
profitable business of making milk and <i>gh&#299;</i>. The
herdsman&rsquo;s duties have been relegated to the mixed class of
Gow&#257;ris, produced from the unions of Ah&#299;rs and Gonds in the
forests, and not improbably <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href=
"#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>including a considerable section
of pure Gond blood. At present only Gaolis and no other caste are
admitted into the Gow&#257;ri community, though there is evidence that
the rule was not formerly so strict.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Subcastes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gow&#257;ris have three divisions, the Gai
Gow&#257;ri, Inga, and M&#257;ria or Gond Gow&#257;ri. The Gai or cow
Gow&#257;ris are the highest and probably have more Gaoli blood in
them. The Inga and M&#257;ria or Gond Gow&#257;ris are more directly
derived from the Gonds. M&#257;ria is the name given to a large section
of the Gond tribe in Ch&#257;nda. Both the other two subcastes will
take cooked food from the Gai Gow&#257;ris and the Gond Gow&#257;ris
from the Inga, but the Inga subcaste will not take it from the Gond,
nor the Gai Gow&#257;ris from either of the other two. The Gond
Gow&#257;ris have been treated as a distinct caste and a separate
article is given on them, but at the census Mr. Marten has amalgamated
them with the Gow&#257;ris. This is probably more correct, as they are
locally held to be a branch of the caste. But their customs differ in
some points from those of the other Gow&#257;ris. They will admit
outsiders from any respectable caste and worship the Gond
gods,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5709src" href="#xd21e5709" name=

the separate article on them to remain.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Totemism and exogamy.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gow&#257;ris have exogamous sections of the
titular and totemistic types, such as Chachania from chachan, a bird,
Loh&#257;r from <i>loha</i> iron, Ambad&#257;re a mango-branch, Kohria
from the Kohri or Kohli caste, Sarwaina a Gond sept, and R&#257;wat the
name of the Ah&#299;r caste in Chhatt&#299;sgarh. Some septs do not
permit intermarriage between their members, saying that they are
D&#363;dh-Bhais or foster-brothers, born from the same mother. Thus the
Chachania, Kohria, Senwaria, Sendua (vermilion) and W&#257;gare (tiger)
septs cannot intermarry. They say that their fathers were different,
but their mothers were related or one and the same. This is apparently
a relic of polyandry, and it is possible that in some cases the Gonds
may have allowed Ah&#299;rs sojourning in the forest to have access to
their wives during the period of their stay. If this was permitted to
Ah&#299;rs of different sections coming to the same Gond village in
successive years, the offspring might be the ancestors of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>sections who consider themselves to be related
to each other in the manner of the Gow&#257;ri sections.</p>
<p>Marriage is prohibited within the same section or <i>kur</i>, and
between sections related to each other as D&#363;dh-Bhais in the manner
explained above. A man can marry his daughter to his sister&rsquo;s
son, but cannot take her daughter for his son. The children of two
sisters cannot be married.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Marriage customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Girls are usually married after attaining maturity,
and a bride-price is paid which is normally two <i>khandis</i> (800
lbs.) of grain, Rs. 16 to 20 in cash, and a piece of cloth. The
auspicious date of the wedding is calculated by a Mah&#257;r Mohturia
or soothsayer. Br&#257;hmans are not employed, the ceremony being
performed by the <i>bh&#257;nya</i> or sister&rsquo;s son of either the
girl&rsquo;s father or the boy&rsquo;s father. If he is not available,
any one whom either the girl&rsquo;s father or the boy&rsquo;s father
addresses as <i>bh&#257;nja</i> or nephew in the village, according to
the common custom of addressing each other by terms of relationship,
even though he may be no relative and belong to another caste, may be
substituted; and if no such person is available a son-in-law of either
of the parties. The peculiar importance thus attached to the
sister&rsquo;s son as a relation is probably a relic of the
matriarchate, when a man&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son was his heir. The
substitution of a son-in-law who might inherit in the absence of a
sister&rsquo;s son perhaps strengthens this view. The wedding is held
mainly according to the Mar&#257;tha ritual.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5741src" href="#xd21e5741" name="xd21e5741src">3</a> The
procession goes to the girl&rsquo;s house, and the bridegroom is
wrapped in a blanket and carries a spear, in the absence of which the
wedding cannot be held. A spear is also essential among the Gonds. The
ancestors of the caste are invited to the wedding by beating a drum and
calling on them to attend. The original ancestors are said to be Kode
Kodwan, the names of two Gond gods, B&#257;ghoba (the tiger-god), and
Meghn&#257;th, son of R&#257;wan, the demon king of Ceylon, after whom
the Gonds are called R&#257;wanvansi, or descendants of R&#257;wan. The
wedding costs about Rs. 50, all of which is spent by the boy&rsquo;s
father. The girl&rsquo;s father only gives a feast to the caste out of
the amount which he receives as bride-price. Divorce and the remarriage
of widows are permitted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href=

<h3 class="main">5. Funeral rites.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dead are either buried or burnt, burial being more
common. The corpse is laid with head to the south and feet to the
north. On returning from the funeral they go and drink at the
liquor-shop, and then kill a cock on the spot where the deceased died,
and offer some meat to his spirit, placing it outside the house. The
caste-fellows sit and wait until a crow comes and pecks at the food,
when they think that the deceased has enjoyed it, and begin to eat
themselves. If no crow comes before night the food may be given to a
cow, and the party can then begin to eat. When the next wedding is held
in the family, the deceased is brought down from the skies and
enshrined among the deified ancestors.</p>

<h3 class="main">6. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The principal deities of the Gow&#257;ris are the Kode
Kodwan or deified ancestors. They are worshipped at the annual
festivals, and also at weddings. When a man or woman dies without
children their spirits are known as Dhal, and are worshipped in the
families to which they belonged. A male Dhal is represented by a stick
of bamboo with one cross-piece at the top, and a female Dhal by a stick
with two others crossing each other lashed to it at the top. These
sticks are worshipped at the Diw&#257;li festival, and carried in
procession. Dudhera is a godling worshipped for the protection of
cattle. He is represented by a clay horse placed near a white ant-hill.
If a cow stops giving milk her udder is smoked with the burning wood of
a tree called <i>s&#257;nwal</i>, and this is supposed to drive away
the spirits who drink the milk from the udder. All Gow&#257;ris revere
the <i>haryal</i>, or green pigeon. They say that it gives a sound like
a Gow&#257;ri calling his cows, and that it is a kinsman. They would on
no account kill this bird. They say that the cows will go to a tree
from which green pigeons are cooing, and that on one occasion when a
thief was driving away their cows a green pigeon cooed from a tree, and
the cows turned round and came back again. This is like the story of
the sacred geese at Rome, who gave warning of the attack of the
Goths.</p>

<h3 class="main">7. Caste rules and the <i>panch&#257;yat</i>.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The head of the caste committee is known as Shendia,
from <i>shendi</i>, a scalp-lock or pig-tail, perhaps because he is at
the top of the caste as the scalp-lock is at the top of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>head. The Shendia is elected, and holds office
for life. He has to readmit offenders into caste by being the first to
eat and drink with them, thus taking their sins on himself. On such
occasions it is necessary to have a little opium, which is mixed with
sugar and water, and distributed to all members of the caste. If the
quantity is insufficient for every one to drink, the man responsible
for preparing it is fined, and this mixture, especially the opium, is
indispensable on all such occasions. The custom indicates that a sacred
or sacrificial character is attributed to the opium, as the drinking of
the mixture together is the sign of the readmission of a temporary
outcaste into the community. After this has been drunk he becomes a
member of the caste, even though he may not give the penalty feast for
some time afterwards. The Ah&#299;rs and Sun&#257;rs of the
Mar&#257;tha country have the same rite of purification by the common
drinking of opium and water. A caste penalty is incurred for the
removal of <i>bit&#257;l</i> or impurity arising from the usual
offences, and among others for touching the corpse of a man of any
other caste, or of a buffalo, horse, cow, cat or dog, for using abusive
language to a casteman at any meeting or feast, and for getting up from
a caste feast without permission from the headman. For touching the
corpse of a prohibited animal and for going to jail a man has to get
his head, beard and whiskers shaved. If a woman becomes with child by a
man of another caste, she is temporarily expelled, but can be
readmitted after the child has been born and she has disposed of it to
somebody else. Such children are often made over for a few rupees to
Muhammadans, who bring them up as menial servants in their families,
or, if they have no child of their own, sometimes adopt them. On
readmission a lock of the woman&rsquo;s hair is cut off. In the same
case, if no child is born of the <i>liaison</i>, the woman is taken
back with the simple penalty of a feast. Permanent expulsion is imposed
for taking food from, or having an intrigue with a member of an impure
caste as M&#257;dgi, Mehtar, Pardh&#257;n, Mah&#257;r and
M&#257;ng.</p>

figures of a peacock, deer or horse on the right shoulder or on both
shoulders. A man without the mark on the forehead will scarcely be
admitted to be a true Gow&#257;ri, and would have to prove his birth

have given their name to the Gujar&#257;t District and the town of
Gujar&#257;nw&#257;la in the Punjab, the peninsula of Gujar&#257;t or
K&#257;thi&#257;w&#257;r and the tract known as G&#363;jargarh in
Gw&#257;lior. In the Central Provinces the G&#363;jars numbered 56,000
persons in 1911, of whom the great majority belonged to the
Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d and Nim&#257;r Districts. In these Provinces the
caste is thus practically confined to the Nerbudda Valley, and they
appear to have come here from Gw&#257;lior probably in the middle of
the sixteenth century, to which period the first important influx of
Hindus into this area has been ascribed. But some of the Nim&#257;r
G&#363;jars are immigrants from Gujar&#257;t. Owing to their
distinctive appearance and character and their exploits as
cattle-raiders, the origin of the G&#363;jars has been the subject of
much discussion. General Cunningham identified them with the Yueh-chi
or Toch&#257;ri, the tribe of Indo-Scythians who invaded India in the
first century of the Christian era. The king Kadphises I. and his
successors belonged to the Kush&#257;n section of the Yueh-chi tribe,
and their rule extended over north-western India down to Gujar&#257;t
in the period 45&ndash;225 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> Mr. V. A.
Smith, however, discards this theory and considers the G&#363;jars or
Gurjaras to have been a branch of the white Huns who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>invaded India in the fifth and sixth centuries.
He writes:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5849src" href="#xd21e5849" name=
"xd21e5849src">1</a> &ldquo;The earliest foreign immigration within the
limits of the historical period which can be verified is that of the
Sakas in the second century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>; and the next
is that of the Yueh-chi and Kush&#257;ns in the first century
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> Probably none of the existing
R&#257;jp&#363;t clans can carry back their genuine pedigrees so far.
The third recorded great irruption of foreign barbarians occurred
during the fifth century and the early part of the sixth. There are
indications that the immigration from Central Asia continued during the
third century, but, if it did, no distinct record of the event has been
preserved, and, so far as positive knowledge goes, only three certain
irruptions of foreigners on a large scale through the northern and
north-western passes can be proved to have taken place within the
historical period anterior to the Muhammadan invasions of the tenth and
eleventh centuries. The first and second, as above observed, were those
of the Sakas and Yueh-chi respectively, and the third was that of the
H&#363;nas or white Huns. It seems to be clearly established that the
Hun group of tribes or hordes made their principal permanent
settlements in the Punjab and R&#257;jput&#257;na. The most important
element in the group after the Huns themselves was that of the
Gurjaras, whose name still survives in the spoken form G&#363;jar as
the designation of a widely diffused middle-class caste in
north-western India. The prominent position occupied by Gurjara
kingdoms in early mediaeval times is a recent discovery. The existence
of a small Gurjara principality in Bhar&#333;ch (Broach), and of a
larger state in R&#257;jput&#257;na, has been known to archaeologists
for many years, but the recognition of the fact that Bhoja and the
other kings of the powerful Kanauj dynasty in the ninth, tenth and
eleventh centuries were Gurjaras is of very recent date and is not yet
general. Certain misreadings of epigraphic dates obscured the true
history of that dynasty, and the correct readings have been established
only within the last two or three years. It is now definitely proved
that Bhoja (<i>circ.</i> <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 840&ndash;890),
his predecessors and successors belonged to the Pratih&#257;ra
(Parih&#257;r) clan of the Gurjara tribe or caste, and, consequently,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=

<h3 class="main">2. The G&#363;jars and the Khazars.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sir J. Campbell identified the G&#363;jars with the
Khazar tribe of Central Asia:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5891src" href=
"#xd21e5891" name="xd21e5891src">3</a> &ldquo;What is known of the
early history of the Gujaras in India points to their arrival during
the last quarter of the fifth or the first quarter of the sixth century
(<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 470&ndash;520). That is the Gujaras seem
to have formed part of the great horde of which the Ju&#257;n-Ju&#257;n
or Av&#257;rs, and the Ephthalites, Yetas or White H&#363;nas were
leading elements. The question remains: How far does the arrival of the
Gujara in India, during the early sixth century, agree with what is
known of the history of the Khazar? The name Khazar appears under the
following forms: Among Chinese as Kosa, among Russians as Khwalisses,
among Byzantines as Chozars or Chazars, among Armenians as Khazirs and
among Arabs as Khozar. Other variations come closer to Gujara. These
are Gazar, the form Kazar takes to the north of the sea of Asof;
Ghysar, the name for Khazars who have become Jews; and Ghusar, the form
of Khazar in use among the Lesghians of the Caucasus. Howarth and the
writer in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> follow Klaproth in
holding that the Khazars are the same as the White H&#363;nas....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admitting that the Khazar and White H&#363;na are one, it
must also be the case that the Khazars included two distinct elements,
a fair or Ak-Khazar, the Akatziroi or Khazaroi of Byzantine historians,
and a dark or K&#257;ra Khazar. The K&#257;ra Khazar was short, ugly
and as black as an Indian. He was the Ughrian nomad of the steppes, who
formed the rank and file of the army. The White Khazar or White
H&#363;na was fair-skinned, black-haired and beautiful, their women (in
the ninth and tenth centuries) being sought after in the baz&#257;rs of
B&#257;ghd&#257;d and Byzantium. According to Klaproth, a view adopted
by the writer in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, the White
Khazar represented the white race <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169"
href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>which, since before Christ
has been settled round the Caspian. As White H&#363;nas,
Ephthalites,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5909src" href="#xd21e5909"
name="xd21e5909src">4</a> White Ughrians and White Bulgars, this white
race were the carriers between Europe and East Asia; they were also the
bearers of the brunt of the Tartar inroads. A trace both of the
beautiful and coarse clans seems to survive in the complimentary
M&#257;rw&#257;r proverb, &lsquo;Handsome as a H&#363;na,&rsquo; and in
the abusive Gujar&#257;t proverb, &lsquo;Yellow and short as a
H&#363;na&rsquo;s beard.&rsquo; Under its Hindu form Gurjara, Khazar
appears to have become the name by which the great bulk of the
sixth-century horde was known.&rdquo; Sir J. Campbell was of opinion
that the Sesodia or Gahlot R&#257;jp&#363;ts, the most illustrious of
all the clans, were of G&#363;jar stock, as well as the Parih&#257;r,
Chauh&#257;n, and Chalukya or Solank&#299;; these last were three of
the Agnikula clans or those created from the firepit,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5915src" href="#xd21e5915" name="xd21e5915src">5</a> and a
Solank&#299; dynasty ruled in Gujar&#257;t. He also considered the
N&#257;gar Br&#257;hmans of Gujar&#257;t to be derived from the
G&#363;jars and considerable sections of the Ah&#299;r and Kunbi
castes. The Badg&#363;jar (great G&#363;jar) clan of R&#257;jp&#363;ts
is no doubt also an aristocratic branch of the caste. In Ajmere it is
said that though all G&#363;jars are not R&#257;jp&#363;ts, no
R&#257;jp&#363;t becomes a hero unless he is suckled by a G&#363;jar
woman. <i>G&#363;jarika dudh, n&#257;hari ka dudh</i>; or
&lsquo;G&#363;jar&rsquo;s milk is tiger&rsquo;s milk.&rsquo; A
R&#257;jp&#363;t who has not been suckled by a G&#363;jar woman is a
<i>gidar</i> or jackal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5925src" href=

<h3 class="main">3. Predatory character of the G&#363;jars in northern
India.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The fact of the White Huns being tall and of fine
features, in contrast to the horde which invaded Europe under Attila,
accounts for these characteristics being found among the highest
R&#257;jp&#363;t clans, who, as has been seen, are probably derived
from them. The G&#363;jar caste generally is now, however, no doubt of
mixed and impure blood. They were distinguished in the past as vagrant
and predatory marauders, and must have assimilated various foreign
elements. Mr. Crooke writes of them:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5936src" href="#xd21e5936" name="xd21e5936src">7</a> &ldquo;The
G&#363;jars as a tribe have always been noted for their turbulence and
habit of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>cattle-stealing. B&#257;bar in his Memoirs
describes how the commander of the rearguard captured a few G&#363;jar
ruffians who followed the camp, decapitated them and sent their heads
to the Emperor. The G&#363;jars of P&#257;li and P&#257;hal became
exceedingly audacious while Sher Sh&#257;h was fortifying Delhi, and he
marched to the hills and expelled them so that not a vestige of their
habitations was left. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r remarks that the G&#363;jars
live chiefly on milk and curds and seldom cultivate land; and
B&#257;bar says: &lsquo;Every time I entered Hindust&#257;n the
J&#257;ts and G&#363;jars have regularly poured down in prodigious
numbers from the hills and wilds to carry off oxen and buffaloes. These
were the wretches that really inflicted the chief hardships and were
guilty of the chief oppression in the country.&rsquo; They maintained
their old reputation in the Mutiny when they perpetrated numerous
outrages and seriously impeded the operations of the British Army
before Delhi.&rdquo; In northern India the G&#363;jars are a pastoral
caste. The saying about them is&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e4473">
<p class="line">Ah&#299;r, Gadaria, G&#363;jar,</p>
<p class="line">E tinon t&acirc;ken ujar,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">or, &lsquo;The Ah&#299;r, Gadaria and G&#363;jar want
waste land&rsquo;; that is for grazing their flocks. In K&#257;ngra the
G&#363;jars generally keep buffaloes. Here they are described as
&ldquo;A fine, manly race with peculiar and handsome features. They are
mild and inoffensive in manner, and in these hills are not
distinguished by the bad pre-eminence which attaches to their race in
the plains.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5953src" href=
"#xd21e5953" name="xd21e5953src">8</a> Sir D. Ibbetson had a very
unfavourable opinion of the G&#363;jars of the plains, of whom he wrote
as follows:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5959src" href="#xd21e5959" name=
"xd21e5959src">9</a> &ldquo;The G&#363;jar is a fine stalwart fellow,
of precisely the same physical type as the J&#257;t; and the theory of
aboriginal descent which has been propounded is to my mind conclusively
negatived by his cast of countenance. He is of the same social standing
as the J&#257;t, or perhaps slightly inferior; but the two eat and
drink in common without any scruple, and the proverb says: &lsquo;The
J&#257;t, G&#363;jar, Ah&#299;r and Gola are all hail fellow well
met.&rsquo; But he is far inferior <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171"
href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>in both personal character
and repute to the J&#257;t. He is lazy to a degree, and a wretched
cultivator; his women, though not secluded, will not do field-work save
of the lightest kind; while his fondness for cattle extends to those of
other people. The difference between a G&#363;jar and a
R&#257;jp&#363;t cattle-thief was once explained to me thus by a
J&#257;t: &lsquo;The R&#257;jp&#363;t will steal your buffalo. But he
will not send his old father to say he knows where it is and will get
it back for Rs. 20, and then keep the Rs. 20 and the buffalo too. The
G&#363;jar will.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Subdivisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The G&#363;jars of the Central Provinces have,
however, entirely given up the predatory habits of their brethren in
northern India and have developed into excellent cultivators and
respectable law-abiding citizens. In Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d they have
three subcastes, Lekha, Mundle and J&#257;dam. The Mundle or
&lsquo;Shaven&rsquo; are so called because they take off their turbans
when they eat and expose their crowns bare of hair, while the Lekha eat
with their turbans on. The Mundle are also known as Rewe, from the Rewa
or Nerbudda, near which they reside. The J&#257;dam are probably an
offshoot from the cultivating caste of Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d of that
name, J&#257;dam being a corruption of J&#257;dubansi, a tribe of
R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The Badg&#363;jars, who belong to Nim&#257;r,
consider themselves the highest, deriving their name from <i>bara</i>
or &lsquo;great&rsquo; G&#363;jar. As already seen, there is a
Badg&#363;jar clan of R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The Nim&#257;r Badg&#363;jars,
however, were formerly engaged in the somewhat humble calling of
clearing cotton of its seeds, and on this account they are also known
as Ludh&#257;re, the word <i>lodhna</i> meaning to work the
hand-ginning machine (<i>charkhi</i>). It seems possible that the small
caste of Lorhas of the Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d District, whose special
avocation is to grow <i>san</i>-hemp, may be derived from these
Ludh&#257;re G&#363;jars. The Kekre or Kanwe subcaste are the lowest
and are of illegitimate descent. They are known as Kekre or
&lsquo;Crabs,&rsquo; but prefer their other name. They will take food
from the other subcastes, but these do not return the compliment.
Another group in the Soh&#257;gpur Tahs&#299;l of Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d
are the Lilorhia G&#363;jars. They say that their ancestors were
grazing calves when some of them with their herdsmen were stolen by
Brahma. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>Then Krishna created fresh cowherds and the
Lilorhias were made from the sweat of his forehead (<i>lilat</i>).
Afterwards Brahma restored the original cowherds, who were known as
Murelia, because they were the first players on the <i>murli</i> or
flute.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5992src" href="#xd21e5992" name=
"xd21e5992src">10</a> The Badg&#363;jars or highest branch of the clan
are descendants of these Murelias. The caste have also a set of
exogamous groups, several of which bear the names of R&#257;jp&#363;t
clans, while others are called after villages, titles or nicknames or
natural objects. A man is not permitted to marry any one belonging
either to his own sept or that of his mother or grandmother.</p>

<h3 class="main">5. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a G&#363;jar wedding four plough-yokes are laid out
to form a square under the marriage booth, with a copper pot full of
water in the centre. At the auspicious moment the bride&rsquo;s hand is
placed on that of the bridegroom, and the two walk seven times round
the pot, the bridegroom leading for the first four rounds and the bride
for the last three. Widows are allowed to remarry, and, as girls are
rather scarce in the caste, a large price is often paid for the widow
to her father or guardian, though this is not willingly admitted. As
much as Rs. 3000 is recorded to have been paid. A widow marriage is
known as N&#257;tra or P&#257;t. A woman is forbidden to marry any
relative of her first husband. When the marriage of a widow is to take
place a fee of Rs. 1&ndash;4 must be paid to the village proprietor to
obtain his consent. The G&#363;jars of the Bulandshahr District of the
United Provinces furnish, Mr. Crooke says,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6000src" href="#xd21e6000" name="xd21e6000src">11</a> perhaps the
only well-established instance of polyandry among the Hindus of the
plains. Owing to the scarcity of women in the caste it was customary
for the wife of one brother, usually the eldest, to be occasionally at
the disposal of other unmarried brothers living in the house. The
custom arose owing to the lack of women caused by the prevalence of
female infanticide, and now that this has been stopped it is rapidly
dying out, while no trace of it is believed to exist in the Central
Provinces.</p>

are cremated. The funeral of an elderly man of good means and family is
an occasion for great display. A large feast is given and the
Br&#257;hman priests of the caste go about inviting all the G&#363;jars
to attend. Sometimes the number of guests rises to three or four
thousand. At the conclusion of the feast one of the hosts claps his
hands and all the guests then get up and immediately depart without
ceremony or saying farewell. Such an occasion is known as
G&#363;jarw&#257;da, and the G&#363;jars often spend as much, or more,
on a funeral as on a wedding, in the belief that the outlay is of
direct benefit to the dead man&rsquo;s spirit. This idea is inculcated
and diligently fostered by the family priests and those Br&#257;hmans
who receive gifts for the use of the dead, the greed of these
cormorants being insatiable.</p>

<h3 class="main">7. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The household goddess of the caste is known as Kul
Devi, the word <i>kul</i> meaning family. To her a platform is erected
inside the house, and she must be worshipped by the members of the
family alone, no stranger being present. Offerings of cocoanuts, rice,
turmeric and flowers are made to her, but no animal sacrifices. When a
son of the family dies unmarried, an image of him, known as Mujia, is
made on a piece of silver, copper or brass, and is worshipped on
Mondays and Fridays during the month of M&#257;gh (January). On one of
these days also a feast is given to the caste. Each member of the caste
has a <i>guru</i> or spiritual preceptor, who visits him every second
or third year and receives a small present of a cocoanut or a piece of
cloth. But he does not seem to perform any duties. The <i>guru</i> may
belong to any of the religious mendicant castes. A man who is without a
<i>guru</i> is known as Nugra and is looked down on. To meet him in the
morning is considered unlucky and portends misfortune. Sir C.
Elliot<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6028src" href="#xd21e6028" name=

of the month, because it is Krishna&rsquo;s birthday. Their religious
and social head is the Mahant of the R&#257;mjid&#257;s temple at
Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d.&rdquo; In Nim&#257;r many of the G&#363;jars
belong to the P&#299;rz&#257;da sect, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The G&#363;jars wear the dress of northern India and
their women usually have skirts (<i>lahenga</i>) and not
<i>s&#257;ris</i> or body-cloths. Married women have a number of
strings of black beads round the neck and widows must change these for
red ones. As a rule neither men nor women are tattooed. The men
sometimes have their hair long and wear beards and whiskers. The
G&#363;jars are now considered the best cultivators of the Nim&#257;r
District. They are fond of irrigation and sink unfaced wells to water
their land and get a second crop off it. They are generally prosperous
and make good landlords. Members of the caste have the custom of
lending and borrowing among themselves and not from outsiders, and this
no doubt conduces to mutual economy and solvency. Like keen cultivators
elsewhere, such as the Panw&#257;rs and Kurmis, the G&#363;jar sets
store by having a good house and good cattle. The return from a Mundle
G&#363;jar&rsquo;s wedding, Captain Forsyth wrote,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6047src" href="#xd21e6047" name="xd21e6047src">13</a> is a
sight to be seen. Every G&#363;jar from far and near has come with his
whole family in his best bullock-cart gaily ornamented, and, whatever
the road may be, nothing but a smash will prevent a breakneck race
homewards at full gallop, cattle which have won in several such races
acquiring a much coveted reputation throughout the District.

<p class="first"><b>Gurao.</b><a class="noteref" id="xd21e6107src"
href="#xd21e6107" name="xd21e6107src">1</a>&mdash;A caste of village
priests of the temples of Mah&#257;deo in the Mar&#257;tha Districts.
They numbered about 14,000 persons in the Central Provinces and
Ber&#257;r in 1911. The Guraos say that they were formerly
Br&#257;hmans and worshippers of Siva, but for some negligence or
mistake in his ritual they were cursed by the god and degraded from the
status of Br&#257;hmans, though subsequently the god relented and
permitted them to worship him and take the offerings made to him.</p>

</div>
<p>It is related that a certain Br&#257;hman, who was a votary of Siva,
had to go on a journey. He left his son behind and strictly enjoined on
him to perform the worship of the god at midday. The son had bathed and
purified himself for this purpose, when shortly before midday his wife
came to him and so importuned him to have conjugal intercourse with her
that he was obliged to comply. It was then midday and in his impure
condition the son went to the shrine of the god to worship him. But
Siva cursed him and said that his descendants should be degraded from
the status of Br&#257;hmans, though he afterwards relented so far as to
permit of their continuing to act as his priests; and this was the
origin of the Guraos. It seems doubtful, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>however, whether the
caste are really of Br&#257;hman origin. They were formerly village
priests, and Grant-Duff gives the Gurao as one of the village menials
in the Mar&#257;tha villages. They have the privilege of taking the
Naivedya or offerings of cooked food made to the god Mah&#257;deo,
which Br&#257;hmans will not accept. They also sell leaf-plates and
flowers and <i>bel</i> leaves<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6125src" href=
"#xd21e6125" name="xd21e6125src">2</a> which are offered at the temples
of Mah&#257;deo; and on the festival of Shivr&#257;tri and during the
month of Shr&#257;wan (July) they take round the <i>bel</i> leaves
which the cultivators require for their offerings and receive presents
in return. In Wardha the Guraos get small gifts of grain from the
cultivators at seed-time and harvest. They also act as village
musicians and blow the conch-shell, beat the drum and play other
musical instruments for the morning and evening worship at the temple.
They play on the cymbals and drums at the marriages of Br&#257;hmans
and other high castes. In the Bombay Presidency<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6134src" href="#xd21e6134" name="xd21e6134src">3</a> some are
astrologers and fortune-tellers, and others make the <i>b&#257;sing</i>
or coronet of flowers which the bridegroom wears. Sometimes they play
on the drum or fiddle for their spiritual followers, the dancing-girls
or Kal&#257;vants. When a dancing-girl became pregnant she worshipped
the Gurao, and he, in return, placed the <i>missi</i> or tooth-powder
made from myrobalans on her teeth. If this was not done before her
child was born, a Kal&#257;vantin was put out of caste. In some
localities the Guraos will take food from Kunbis. And further, as will
be seen subsequently, the caste have no proper <i>gotras</i> or
exogamous sections, but in arranging their marriages they simply avoid
persons having a common surname. All these considerations point to the
fact that the caste is not of Br&#257;hmanical origin but belongs to a
lower class of the population. Nevertheless in Wardha they are known as
Shaiva Br&#257;hmans and rank above the Kunbis. They may study the
S&#257;ma Veda only and not the others, and may repeat the Rudra
Gayatri or sacred verse of Siva. Clearly the Br&#257;hmans could not
accept the offerings of cooked food made at Siva&rsquo;s shrine; though
the larger temples of this deity have Br&#257;hman priests. It seems
uncertain whether <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177"
name="pb177">177</a>]</span>Siva or Mah&#257;deo was first a village
deity and was subsequently exalted to the position of a member of the
supreme Hindu Trinity, or whether the opposite process took place and
the Guraos obtained their priestly functions on his worship being
popularised. But in any case it would appear that they were originally
a class of village priests regarded as the servants of the cultivating
community, by whose gifts and offerings they were maintained.
Grant-Duff in enumerating the village servants says: &ldquo;Ninth, the
Gurao, who is a S&#363;dra employed to wash the ornaments and attend
the idol in the village temples, and on occasions of feasting to
prepare the <i>patraoli</i> or leaves which the Hindus substitute for
plates. They are also trumpeters by profession and in this capacity are
much employed in Mar&#257;tha armies.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">2. Internal structure.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste has several subdivisions which are
principally of a territorial nature, as War&#257;de from Ber&#257;r;
Jh&#257;de, inhabitants of the forest or rice country; Telanga, of the
Telugu country; Dakshne, from the Deccan; M&#257;rw&#257;ri, from
M&#257;rw&#257;r, and so on. Other subcastes are the Ah&#299;r and Jain
Guraos, of whom the former are apparently Ah&#299;rs who have adopted
the priestly profession, while the Jain Guraos are held in Bombay to be
the descendants of Jain temple servants who entered the caste when
their own deities were thrown out and their shrines annexed by the
votaries of Siva.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6164src" href="#xd21e6164"
name="xd21e6164src">5</a> In Bombay, Mr. Enthoven states &ldquo;That
the Koli and Mar&#257;tha ministrants at the temples of Siva and other
deities often describe themselves as Guraos, but they have not formed
themselves into separate castes and are members of the general Koli or
Mar&#257;tha community. They cease to call themselves Guraos when they
cease to minister at temples.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6169src" href="#xd21e6169" name="xd21e6169src">6</a> In the
Central Provinces one of the subcastes is known as V&#257;jantri
because they act as village musicians. The caste have no regular
exogamous sections, but a number of surnames which answer the same
purpose. These are of a professional type, as Lokhandes, an
iron-dealer; Phulzares, a maker of fireworks; Sontake, a gold-merchant;
Gaikw&#257;d, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>a cowherd; N&#257;kade, long-nosed, and so on.
They say they all belong to the same <i>gotra</i>,
S&#257;nkhi&#257;yan, named after S&#257;nkhi&#257;ya Rishi, the
ancestor of the caste.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Marriage and ceremonies of adolescence.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage is avoided between persons having the same
surname and those within six degrees of descent from a common ancestor
whether male or female. The marriage ceremony generally resembles that
of the Br&#257;hmans. Before the wedding the bridegroom&rsquo;s father
prepares an image of Siva from rice and til-seed,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6183src" href="#xd21e6183" name="xd21e6183src">7</a> covers it
with a cloth and sends it to the bride&rsquo;s house. In return her
mother prepares and sends back a similar image of Gauri, Siva&rsquo;s
consort. Girls are married as infants, and when a woman arrives at
adolescence the following ritual is observed: She goes to her
husband&rsquo;s house and is there secluded for three or four days
while her impurity lasts. On its termination she is bathed and clothed
in a green dress and yellow <i>choli</i> or breast-cloth, and seated in
a gaily decked wooden frame. Her lap is filled with wheat and a
cocoanut, and her female friends and relatives and father and
father-in-law give her presents of sweets and clothes. This is known as
the Sh&#257;ntik ceremony and is practised by the higher castes in the
Mar&#257;tha country. It may continue for as long as sixteen days.
Finally, on an auspicious day the bride and bridegroom are given
delicate food and dressed in new clothes. The fire sacrifice is offered
and they are taken into a room where a bed, the gift of the
bride&rsquo;s parents, has been prepared for them, and left to
consummate the marriage. This is known as Garbh&#257;dh&#257;n. Next
day the bride&rsquo;s parents give new clothes and a feast to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s family; this feast is known as Godai, and after
giving it the bride&rsquo;s parents may eat at their daughter&rsquo;s
house. A girl seduced by a man of the caste may be properly married to
him after her parents have performed <i>Pr&#257;yaschit</i> or
atonement. But if she has a child out of wedlock, he is relegated to
the Vid&#363;r or illegitimate group. Even if a girl be seduced by a
stranger, provided he be of higher or equal caste, as the Kunbis and
Mar&#257;thas, she may be taken back into the community.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Birth customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If a child is born at an unlucky season, they take two
winnowing-fans and tie the baby between them with a thread <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>wound many times round about. A cow is brought
and made to lick the child, which is thus supposed to have been born
again from it as a calf, the evil omen of the first birth being
removed. The father performs the fire sacrifice, and a human figure is
made from cooked rice and worshipped. A burning wick is placed in its
stomach and it is taken out and left at cross-roads, this being
probably a substitute for the member of the family whose death was
presaged by the untimely birth of the child. Similarly if any one dies
at the astronomical period known as Panchak, they make five figures of
wheat-flour and burn or bury them with the body, as it is thought that
otherwise five members of the family would die.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. The sacred thread.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Boys are invested with the sacred thread at the age of
five, seven or nine years, and until that time they are considered to
be S&#363;dras and not members of the caste. From a hundred to three
hundred rupees may be spent on the investiture. On the day before the
ceremony a Br&#257;hman and his wife are invited to take food, and a
yellow thread with a mango leaf is tied round the boy&rsquo;s wrist.
The spirits of other boys who died before their thread ceremony was
performed and of women of the family who died before their husbands are
invited to attend. These are represented by young boys and married
women of other families who come to the house and are bathed and
anointed with turmeric and oil, and given presents of sugar and new
clothes. Next day the initiate is seated on a platform in a shed
erected for the purpose and puts on the sacred thread made of cotton
and also a strip of the skin of the black-buck with a silk apron and
cap. The boy&rsquo;s father takes him on his lap and whispers or, as
the Hindus say, blows the G&#257;yatri <i>mantra</i> or sacred text
into his ear. A sacrifice is performed, and the friends and
fellow-castemen of the family make presents to the boy of copper and
silver coin. The amount thus given is not used by the parents, but is
spent on the boy&rsquo;s education or on the purchase of an ornament
for him. On the conclusion of the ceremony the boy mounts a wooden
model of a horse and pretends to set out for Ben&#257;res. His paternal
uncle then says to him, &lsquo;Why are you going away?&rsquo; And the
boy replies, &lsquo;Because you have not married me.&rsquo; His uncle
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>then promises to find a bride for him and he
gives up his project. The part played by the maternal uncle in this
ceremony is probably a survival of the period of the matriarchate, when
a man&rsquo;s property descended to his sister&rsquo;s son. He would
thus naturally claim the boy as a husband for his own daughter, and
such a marriage apparently became customary and in course of time
acquired binding force. And although all recollection of the rule of
inheritance through women has long been forgotten, the marriage of a
brother&rsquo;s daughter to a sister&rsquo;s son is still considered
peculiarly suitable, and the idea that it is the duty of the maternal
uncle to find a bride for his nephew appears to be simply a development
of this. The above account also gives reason for supposing that the
investiture with the sacred thread was originally a ceremony of
puberty.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dead are burnt and the ashes thrown into water or
carried to the Ganges. A small piece of gold, two or three small
pearls, and some basil leaves are put into the mouth, and flowers, red
powder and betel leaves are spread over the corpse. The son or male
heir of the deceased walks in front carrying fire in an earthen pot. At
a small distance from the burning-ground, when the bearers change
places, he picks up a stone, known as the life-stone or
<i>jivkhada</i>. This is afterwards buried at the
burning-<i>gh&#257;t</i> until the priest comes to effect the
purification of the mourners on the tenth day. It is then dug up, set
up and worshipped, and thrown into a well. A man is burnt naked; a
woman in a robe and bodice. The heads of widows are not shaved as a
rule, but on the tenth day after her husband&rsquo;s death a widow is
asked whether she would like her head shaved; if she refuses, the
people conclude that she intends to marry again. But if the deceased
left no male heir to carry behind his bier the burning wood with which
the funeral pyre is to be kindled, then the widow must be shaved before
the funeral starts and perform this duty. If there is no male relative
and no widow, the pot containing fire is tied to the bier. When the
corpse of a woman who has died in child-bed is being carried to the
burning-ground various rites are observed to prevent her spirit from
becoming a Churel and troubling the living. <span class=

<h3 class="main">8. The Jain Guraos.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the Jain Guraos Mr. Enthoven quotes the following
interesting description from the <i>Bombay Gazetteer</i>: &ldquo;They
are mainly servants in village temples which, though dedicated to
Br&#257;hmanic gods, have still by their sides broken remains of Jain
images. This, and the fact that most of the temple land-grants date
from a time when Jainism was the State religion, support the theory
that the Jain Guraos are probably Jain temple servants who have come
under the influence partly of Ling&#257;yatism and partly of
Br&#257;hmanism. A curious survival of their Jainism occurs at Dasahra,
Shimga and other leading festivals, when the village deity is taken out
of the temple and carried in procession. On these occasions, in front
of the village god&rsquo;s palanquin, three, five or seven of the
villagers, among whom the Gurao is always the leader, carry each a
long, gaily-painted wooden pole resting against their right shoulder.
At the top of the pole is fastened a silver mask or hand and round it
is draped a rich silk robe. Of these poles, the chief one, carried by
the Gurao, is called the Jain&rsquo;s pillar, <i>Jain&#257;cha
kh&#257;mb</i>.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href=

<h3 class="main">1. Traditions of the caste.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Halba</b>, <b>Halbi</b>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6376src" href="#xd21e6376" name="xd21e6376src">1</a>&mdash;A
caste of cultivators and farmservants whose home is the south of the
Raipur District and the K&#257;nker and Bastar States; from here small
numbers of them have spread to Bhand&#257;ra and parts of Ber&#257;r.
In 1911 they numbered 100,000 persons in the combined Provinces. The
Halbas have several stories relating to their own origin. One of these,
reported by Mr. Gokul Pras&#257;d, is as follows: One of the Uriya
R&#257;jas had erected four scarecrows in his field to keep off the
birds. One night Mah&#257;deo and P&#257;rvati were walking on the
earth and happened to pass that way, and P&#257;rvati saw them and
asked what they were. When it was explained to her she thought that as
they had excited her interest something should be done for them, and at
her request Mah&#257;deo gave them life <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>and they became two
men and two women. Next morning they presented themselves before the
R&#257;ja and told him what had happened. The R&#257;ja said,
&ldquo;Since you have come on earth, you must have a caste. Run after
Mah&#257;deo and find out what caste you should belong to.&rdquo; So
they ran after the god and inquired of him, and he said that as they
had excited his and P&#257;rvati&rsquo;s attention by waving in the
wind they should be called Halba, from <i>halna</i>, to wave. This
story is clearly based on one of those fanciful punning derivations so
dear to the Br&#257;hmanical mind, but the legend about being created
from scarecrows is found among other agricultural castes of non-Aryan
origin, as the Lodhis. The story continues that the reason why the
Halbas came to settle in Bastar and K&#257;nker was that they had
accompanied one of the R&#257;jas of Jagann&#257;th in Orissa, who was
afflicted with leprosy, to the Sih&#257;wa jungles, where he proposed
to pass the rest of his life in retirement. On a certain day the
R&#257;ja went out hunting with his dogs, one of which was quite white.
This dog jumped into a spring of water and came out with his white skin
changed to copper red. The R&#257;ja, observing this miracle, bathed in
the spring himself and was cured of his leprosy. He then wished to
return to Orissa, but the Halbas induced him to remain in his adopted
country, and he became the ancestor of the R&#257;jas of K&#257;nker.
The Halbas are still the household servants of the K&#257;nker family,
and when a fresh chief succeeds, one of them, who has the title of
Kapard&#257;r, takes him to the temple and invests him with the
<i>Durb&#257;r k&#299; poshak</i> or royal robes, affixing also the
<i>t&#299;ka</i> or badge of office on his forehead with turmeric, rice
and sandalwood, and rubbing his body over with ottar of roses. Until
lately the Kapard&#257;r&rsquo;s family had a considerable grant of
rent-free land, but this has now been taken away. A Halba is or was
also the priest of the temple at Sih&#257;wa, which is said to have
been built by the first R&#257;ja over the spring where he was healed
of his leprosy. The Halbas are also connected with the R&#257;jas of
Bastar, and a suggestion has been made<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6391src" href="#xd21e6391" name="xd21e6391src">2</a> that they
originally belonged to the Telugu country and came with the R&#257;jas
of Bastar from Warangal in the Deccan. Mr. Gilder derives <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>the
name from an old Canarese word <i>Halbar</i> or <i>Halbaru</i>, meaning
&lsquo;old ones or ancients&rsquo; or &lsquo;primitive
inhabitants.&rsquo; The Halba dialect, however, contains no traces of
Canarese, and on the question of their entering Bastar with the
R&#257;jas, Rai Bah&#257;dur Panda Baijn&#257;th, Diw&#257;n of Bastar,
writes as follows: In the following saying relating to the coming of
the Bastar R&#257;jas, which is often repeated, the Halba&rsquo;s name
does not occur:</p>
<div class="table">
<table>
<tr>
<td><i>Chalkibans R&#257;ja</i></td>
<td><i>Dibdibi b&#257;ja.</i></td>

<tr>
<td><i>Kosaria R&#257;wat</i></td>
<td><i>Pita Bhatra.</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Peng Parja</i></td>
<td><i>R&#257;ja Muria.</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Tendukhuti</i></td>
<td><i>Pania lava.</i></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Which may be rendered: &ldquo;The R&#257;ja was of the Chalki
race.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6442src" href="#xd21e6442" name=
"xd21e6442src">3</a> The drum was called Dibdibi. Kosaria R&#257;wat,

castes came with the R&#257;ja. The tribute paid (to the R&#257;ja) was
a comb of <i>tendu</i> wood and a <i>lava</i> quail.&rdquo; This
doggerel rhyme is believed to recall the circumstances of the
immigration of the Bastar R&#257;jas. So the Halbas did not perhaps
come with the R&#257;ja, but they were his guards for a long time. In
the Dasahra ceremony a Halba carried the royal Chhatra or Umbrella, and
the R&#257;ja walked under the protection of another Halba&rsquo;s
naked sword. A Halba&rsquo;s widows were not sold and his intestate
property was not taken over by the R&#257;ja.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Halba landowners in Bastar and Bhand&#257;ra.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thus the Halbas occupy a comparatively honourable
position in Bastar. They are the highest local caste with the exception
of the Br&#257;hmans, the Dh&#257;kars or illegitimate descendants of
Br&#257;hmans, and a few R&#257;jp&#363;t families. The reason for this
is no doubt that they have become landholders in the State, a position
which it would not be difficult for them to acquire when their only
rivals were the Gonds. They are moderately good cultivators, and in
Dhamtari can hold their own with Hindus, so that they could well
surpass the Gond. Traditions also remain in Bastar of a Halba revolt.
It is said that during R&#257;ja <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185"
href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>Daryao Deo&rsquo;s reign,
about 125 years back, the Halbas rebelled and many were thrown down a
waterfall ninety feet high, one only of these escaping with his life.
The eyes of some were also put out as a punishment for the oppression
they had exercised, and a stone inscription at Donger records the oath
of fealty taken by the Halbas before the image of Danteshwari, the
tutelary deity of Bastar, after their insurrection was put down in
Samvat 1836 or <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1779. The Halbas were thus
a caste of considerable influence, since they could attempt to subvert
the ruling dynasty. In Bhand&#257;ra again the caste have quite a
different story, and say that they came from the United Provinces or,
according to another version, the Makrai State, where they were of the
status of R&#257;jp&#363;ts and wore the sacred thread. There a girl of
their family, of great beauty, was asked in marriage by a Muhammadan
king. The father could not refuse the king, but would not give his
daughter in marriage to one not of his own caste. So he fled south and
took asylum with the Gond R&#257;ja of Ch&#257;nda, from whom the Halba
zam&#299;nd&#257;rs subsequently received their estates. It seems
unnecessary to attach any importance to this story; the tale of the
beautiful daughter is most hackneyed, and the whole has probably been
devised by the Br&#257;hmans to give the Halba zam&#299;nd&#257;rs of
Bhand&#257;ra a more respectable ancestry than they could claim if they
admitted having come from Bastar, certainly no home of
R&#257;jp&#363;ts. But if this supposition is correct it is interesting
to note how a legend may show a caste as originating in some place with
which it never had any connection whatever; and it seems a necessary
conclusion that no importance can be attached to such traditions
without corroborating evidence.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">3. Internal structure: subcastes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste have local divisions known as Bastarha,
Chhatt&#299;sgarhia and Marethia, according as they live in Bastar,
Chhatt&#299;sgarh, or Bhand&#257;ra and the other Mar&#257;tha
Districts. The last two groups, however, intermarry, so only the Bastar
Halbas really form a separate subcaste. But the caste is also
everywhere divided into two groups of pure and mixed Halbas. These are
known in Bastar and Chhatt&#299;sgarh as Pur&#257;it or Nekha, and
Sur&#257;it or N&#257;yak, respectively, and in Bhand&#257;ra as
Barpangat and Kh&#257;lpangat or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186"
href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>those of good and bad stock.
The Sur&#257;its or Kh&#257;lpangats are said to be of mixed origin,
born from Halba fathers and women of other castes. But in past times
unions of Halba mothers and men of other castes were perhaps not less
frequent. These two sets of groups do not intermarry. A Sur&#257;it
Halba will take food from a Pur&#257;it, but the Pur&#257;its do not
return the compliment; though in some localities they will accept food
which does not contain salt. The two divisions will take water from
each other and exchange leaf-pipes. In Bhand&#257;ra the Barpangat or
pure Halbas have now further split into two groups, the
zam&#299;nd&#257;ri families having constituted themselves into a
separate subdivision; they practise hypergamy with the others, taking
daughters from them in marriage but not giving their daughters to them.
This is simply of a piece with their claim to be R&#257;jp&#363;ts,
hypergamy being a custom of northern India.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">4. Exogamous sections.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The exogamous sections of the caste afford further
evidence of their mixed origin. Many of the names recorded are those of
other castes, as Baretha (a washerman), Bhoyar (Bhoi or bearer),
R&#257;wat (herdsman), Barhai (carpenter), M&#257;lia (M&#257;li or
gardener), Dh&#257;kar (Vid&#363;r or illegitimate Br&#257;hman),
Bhand&#257;ri (barber), Pardh&#257;n (Gond), M&#257;nkar (title of
various tribes), Sahara (Saonr), Kanderi (turner), Agri (Agarw&#257;la
Bania), Baghel (a sept of R&#257;jp&#363;ts), Elmia (from Velama,
Telugu cultivators), and Chalki and Ponw&#257;r (Chalukya and
Panw&#257;r R&#257;jp&#363;ts). It may be concluded that these groups
are descended from ancestors of the caste after which they are named.
There are also a number of territorial and titular names of the usual
type, and many totemistic names, as Ghorapatia (a horse), Kawaliha
(lotus), Aurila (tamarind), Lendia (a tree), Gohi (a lizard), Manjur (a
peacock), Bhringr&#257;j (a blackbird) and so on. In Bastar they revere
the animal or plant after which their sept is named and will not kill
or injure it. If a man accidentally kills his <i>devak</i> or sacred
animal he will tear off a small piece of his cloth and throw it away to
make a shroud for the corpse. A few of them will break their earthen
pots as if a relative had died in their house, but this is not general.
In Bastar the totemistic groups are named <i>barags</i>, and many men
also belong to a <i>thok</i>, having some titular name which they use
as a surname. Nowadays <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=
"#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>marriage is avoided by persons
having the same <i>thok</i> or surname as well as between those of the
same <i>barag</i>.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Theory of the origin of the caste.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In view of the information available the most probable
theory of the origin of the Halbas is that they were a mixed caste,
born of irregular alliances between the Uriya R&#257;jas and their
retainers with the women of their household servants and between the
different servants themselves. Mr. Gokul Pras&#257;d points out that
many of the names of Halba sections are those of the <i>haguas</i> or
household menials of the Uriya chiefs. The Halbas, according to their
own story, came here in attendance on one of the chiefs, and are still
employed as household servants in K&#257;nker and Bastar. They are
clearly a caste of mixed origin as they still admit women of other
castes married by Halba men into the community, and one of their two
subcastes in each locality consists of families of impure descent. The
Dh&#257;kars of Bastar are the illegitimate offspring of Br&#257;hmans
with women of the country who have grown into a caste, and Mr. Panda
Baijn&#257;th quotes a proverb, saying that &lsquo;The Halbas and
Dh&#257;kars form two portions of a bedsheet.&rsquo; Instances of other
castes similarly formed are the Audhelias of Bil&#257;spur, who are
said to be the offspring of Daharia R&#257;jp&#363;ts by their kept
women, and the Barg&#257;hs, descended from the nurses of
R&#257;jp&#363;t families. The name Halba might be derived from
<i>hal</i>, a plough, and be a variant for <i>harw&#257;ha</i>, the
common term for a farmservant in the northern Districts. This
derivation they give themselves in one of their stories, saying that
their first ancestor was created from a sod of earth on the plough of
Balar&#257;m or Haladhara, the brother of Krishna; and it has also the
support of Sir G. Grierson. The caste includes no doubt a number of
Gonds, R&#257;wats (herdsmen) and others, and it may be partly
occupational, consisting of persons employed as farmservants by the
Hindu settlers. The farmservant in Chhatt&#299;sgarh has a very
definite position, his engagement being permanent and his wages
consisting always in a fourth share of the produce, which is divided
among them when several are employed. The caste have a peculiar dialect
of their own, which Dr. Grierson describes as follows:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6513src" href="#xd21e6513" name="xd21e6513src">5</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>&ldquo;Linguistic evidence also points to the
fact that the Halbas are an aboriginal tribe, who have adopted Hinduism
and an Aryan language. Their dialect is a curious mixture of Uriya,
Chhatt&#299;sgarhi and Mar&#257;thi, the proportions varying according
to the locality. In Bhand&#257;ra it is nearly all Mar&#257;thi, but in
Bastar it is much more mixed and has some forms which look like
Telugu.&rdquo; If the home of the Halbas was in the debateable land
between Chhatt&#299;sgarh and the Uriya country to the east and south
of the Mah&#257;nadi, their dialect might, as Mr. <span class="corr"
id="xd21e6521" title="Source: Hira">H&#299;ra</span> L&#257;l points
out, have originated here. They themselves give the ruined but once
important city of Sih&#257;wa on the banks of the Mah&#257;nadi in this
tract as that of their first settlement; and Uriya is spoken to the
east of Sih&#257;wa and Mar&#257;thi to the west, while
Chhatt&#299;sgarhi is the language of the locality itself and of the
country extending north and south. Subsequently the Halbas served as
soldiers in the armies of the Ratanpur kings and their position no
doubt considerably improved, so that in Bastar they became an important
landholding caste. Some of these soldiers may have migrated west and
taken service under the Gond kings of Ch&#257;nda, and their
descendants may now be represented by the Bhand&#257;ra
zam&#299;nd&#257;rs, who, however, if this theory be correct, have
entirely forgotten their origin. Others took up weaving and have become
amalgamated with the Koshti caste in Bhand&#257;ra and Ber&#257;r.</p>

<h3 class="main">6. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Girls are not usually married until they are above ten
years old, or nearly adult as age goes in India; but there is no rule
on the subject. Many girls reach twenty without entering wedlock. If
the parents are too poor to pay for their daughter&rsquo;s marriage the
neighbours will subscribe. In Bastar, however, the Uriya custom
prevails, and an unmarried girl in whom the signs of puberty appear is
put out of caste. In such a case her father marries her to a mahua
tree. The strictness of the rule on this subject among the Uriyas is
probably due to the strength of Br&#257;hmanical influence, the
priestly caste possessing more power and property in Sambalpur and
Orissa than in almost any part of India. If a death occurs in the
family of the bridegroom just before the date fixed for the wedding,
and the ceremonies of purification cannot be completed prior to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>it, the bride is formally wedded to an
<i>achar</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e6533src" href="#xd21e6533"
name="xd21e6533src">6</a> or mahua tree;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6537src" href="#xd21e6537" name="xd21e6537src">7</a> the marriage
crown is tied on to the tree, and the bride walks round it seven times.
After the bridegroom&rsquo;s purification the couple are taken to the
same tree, and here the forehead of the bridegroom is marked with
turmeric paste and rice. The couple sit one on each side of the tree,
and the Tik&#257;wan ceremony or presentation of gifts by the relatives
and friends is performed, and the marriage is considered to be
complete. If an unmarried girl goes wrong with an outsider of low caste
she is expelled from the community; but if with a member of a caste
from whom a Halba can take water she may be readmitted to caste,
provided she has not eaten food cooked in an earthen pot from the hands
of her seducer; but not if she has done so. If there be a child of the
seducer she must wait until it be weaned and either taken by the
putative father or given away to a Cham&#257;r or Gond. The girl can
then be given in marriage to any Halba as a widow. Women of other
castes married by Halbas are admitted into the community. This happens
most frequently in the case of women of the R&#257;wat (herdsman)
caste.</p>

<h3 class="main">7. Importance of the sister&rsquo;s son.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A match which is commonly arranged where practicable
is that of a brother&rsquo;s daughter to a sister&rsquo;s son. And a
man always shows a special regard and respect for his sister&rsquo;s
son, touching his feet as to a superior, while, whenever he desires to
make a gift as an offering of thanks or atonement or as a meritorious
action, the sister&rsquo;s son is the recipient. At his death he
usually leaves a substantial legacy, such as one or two buffaloes, to
his sister&rsquo;s son, the remainder of the property going to his own
family. This recognition of a special relationship is probably a
survival of the matriarchate, when property descended through women,
and a sister&rsquo;s son would be his uncle&rsquo;s heir. Thus a man
would naturally desire to marry his daughter to his nephew in order
that she might participate in his property, and hence arose the custom
of making this match, which is still the most favoured among the Halbas
and Gonds, though <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190"

<p class="first">Matches are usually arranged on the initiative of the
boy&rsquo;s father through a mutual friend who resides in the
girl&rsquo;s village, and is known as the Mah&#257;lia or matchmaker.
When the contract is concluded the boy&rsquo;s father sends a present
of fixed quantities of grain to the girl, which are in the nature of a
bride-price, and subsequently on an auspicious day selected by the
family priest he and his friends proceed to the girl&rsquo;s village.
The girl meets them, standing at the entrance of the principal house,
dressed in the new clothes sent on behalf of the bridegroom, and
holding out her cloth for the reception of presents. The boy&rsquo;s
father goes up to her and smooths her hair with his hand, chucks her
under the chin with his right hand, and makes a noise with his lips as
if he were kissing her. He then touches her feet, places a rupee on the
skirt of her cloth, and retires. The other members of his party follow
his example, giving small presents of copper, and afterwards the women
of the girl&rsquo;s party treat the bridegroom in the same manner, but
they actually kiss him (<i>ch&#363;mna</i>). Betrothals can be held
only in the five months from M&#257;gh (January) to Jeth (May), while
marriages may be celebrated during the eight dry months. The auspicious
date is selected by the Joshi or caste-priest, who is chosen by the
community for his personal qualities. If the names of the couple do not
point to an auspicious union the bridegroom&rsquo;s name may be changed
either temporarily or permanently. The Joshi takes two pieces of cloth,
which should be torn from the scarf of the boy&rsquo;s father, and ties
up in each of them some rice, areca nuts, turmeric and <i>d&#363;b</i>
grass (<i>Cynodon dactylon</i>). One of these is marked with red lead,
and is intended for the bride, and the other, which is left plain, is
for the bridegroom. At the wedding some of this rice with pulse is
placed with a twig of mahua in a hole in the marriage-shed and
addressed: &lsquo;You are the goddess Lachhmi; you have come to assist
in the marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Halbas, like the other lower castes of Chhatt&#299;sgarh, have
two forms of wedding, known as the &lsquo;Small&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Large,&rsquo; the former being held at the bridegroom&rsquo;s
house with curtailed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191"
name="pb191">191</a>]</span>ceremonies, and being much cheaper than the
latter or Hindu marriage proper, which is held at the bride&rsquo;s
house. The &lsquo;small&rsquo; wedding is more popular among the
Halbas, and for this the bride, accompanied by some of her girl and boy
friends, arrives at the bridegroom&rsquo;s village in the evening, her
parents following her only on the third day. On entering the lands of
the village her party begin singing obscene songs filled with abuse of
the bridegroom&rsquo;s parents and relatives. Nobody goes to receive or
welcome them, and on reaching the bridegroom&rsquo;s house they enter
it without ceremony and sit down in the room where the family gods are
kept. All this time they continue singing, and the musicians keep up a
deafening din in accompaniment. Subsequently the bride&rsquo;s party
are shown to their lodging, known as the <i>Dulhi-kuria</i> or
bride&rsquo;s apartments, and here the bridegroom&rsquo;s father visits
her and washes her big toes first with milk and then with water. The
practice of washing the feet of guests, which strikes strangely on our
minds when we meet it in Scripture, was obviously a welcome attention
when travellers went bare-footed, or at most wore sandals, and arrived
at their journey&rsquo;s end with the feet soiled and bruised by the
rigours of the way. Another of the bridegroom&rsquo;s friends pretends
to act as a barber, and shaves all the bride&rsquo;s men friends with a
piece of straw as if it were a razor. For the marriage ceremony proper
the bride and bridegroom stand facing each other by the marriage hut
with a sheet held between them; the Joshi or caste-priest takes two
lamps and mingles their flames, and the cloth between the couple being
pulled down the bridegroom drags the bride over to him. If the wedding
is held on a Sunday, Tuesday or Saturday the bridegroom stands facing
the east, and if on a Monday, Thursday or Friday, to the north. After
this the cloths of the couple are tied together, or the end of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s scarf is tucked in the bride&rsquo;s waistcloth, and
they go round the marriage-post seven times, the bride following the
bridegroom throughout. A plough-yoke is then brought and placed close
by the marriage-post and the couple take their seats on it, the bride
sitting on the left of the bridegroom. The bundles of rice consecrated
by the Joshi are given to them and they throw it over each other. The
bridegroom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>takes some red lead and smears the bride&rsquo;s
face with it, making a line from the end of her nose up across her
forehead and along the parting of her hair. He says her name aloud and
covers her head with her cloth. This signifies that she is a married
woman, as in Chhatt&#299;sgarh unmarried girls go about with the head
bare. After this the mother and father of the bride come and wash the
feet of the couple with milk and water. This ceremony is known as
Dharam T&#299;ka, and after its completion the bride&rsquo;s parents
will take food in the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, which they abstain from
doing from the date of the betrothal up to this washing of the feet. It
is on this account that they do not accompany the bride but only follow
her on the third day, but the reason for the rule is by no means clear.
On the following day more ceremonies are performed, and the friends of
the couple touch their foreheads with rice and make presents to them of
cowries. Last of all the bride&rsquo;s parents come and give them
cattle and other articles according to their means. These gifts are
known as Tik&#257;wan and remain the separate property of the bride
which she can dispose of as she pleases. The ceremonies usually extend
over four days, the wedding itself taking place on the third. The
bride&rsquo;s party then go home, leaving her with her husband, and
after a week or so they return and take the couple to the bride&rsquo;s
house for the ceremony known as Pinar Dhawai or getting their yellow
wedding clothes washed. The bridegroom stays here two or three weeks,
and during this time he must work at building or repairing the walls of
his father-in-law&rsquo;s house. The custom of serving for a wife still
obtains among the Halbas, and the above rule may perhaps indicate that
it was once more general. At the end of the bridegroom&rsquo;s visit
his father-in-law gives him a new cloth and pair of shoes and sends him
back to his parents&rsquo; house with his wife. The expenses of the
wedding average about fifty rupees for the bridegroom&rsquo;s family
and from five to thirty rupees for the bride&rsquo;s family.</p>

<h3 class="main">9. Going-away ceremony.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After the wedding if the bride is grown up she lives
with her husband at once; but if she is a child she goes back to her
parents until her adolescence, when the ceremony of Pathoni or
&lsquo;Going away&rsquo; is performed. On this occasion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>some
people from the bridegroom&rsquo;s home go to fetch her and their
number must be even, so that when she returns with them the party may
be an odd one, which is lucky. They take a new cloth for the bride and
stay the night at her house; next morning the bride&rsquo;s parents put
some rice, pulse, oil and a comb in a basket for her, and she sets out
with the party, wearing her new cloth. But when she gets outside the
village this is taken off her and placed in the basket, which she has
to carry on her head as far as her husband&rsquo;s house. As she enters
his village the people stretch a rope across the way and prevent her
passage until her father-in-law gives them a present. On arriving at
his house her feet are washed by her mother-in-law, and she is then
made to cook the food brought in her basket. After a fortnight she
again goes back to her parents&rsquo; house and stays with them for
another year, before finally taking up her abode with her husband. It
has been remarked that this return of a married woman to her
parents&rsquo; house for such lengthened periods is likely to be a
pregnant source of immorality, and the advantage of the custom has been
questioned; the explanation may perhaps be that it is an outcome of the
joint family system by which young married couples live with the
bridegroom&rsquo;s parents, and that the object is to accustom the girl
gradually to the habits of a fresh household and the yoke, necessarily
irksome, of her mother-in-law. The proverb with reference to a young
wife, &lsquo;If your husband loves you your mother-in-law can do
nothing,&rsquo; indicates how formidable this may be in the event of
any cooling of marital affection; and it is well known that if she does
not please her husband&rsquo;s family a young wife may be treated as
little better than a slave. To throw a young girl, therefore, into a
family of complete strangers is probably too severe a trial, and this
is the reason of the goings and returnings of the bride after her
wedding between her husband&rsquo;s home and her own.</p>

<h3 class="main">10. Widow-marriage and divorce.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The remarriage of a widow must be held during the
bright fortnight of the month, and on any odd day of the fortnight
excluding the first. The couple are seated together on a yoke in a part
of the courtyard cleaned with cowdung, and their clothes are tied
together, while the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194"
name="pb194">194</a>]</span>husband rubs vermilion on his wife&rsquo;s
hair. A bachelor should not take a widow in marriage, and if he does so
he must at the same time also wed a maiden with the regular ceremony,
as otherwise he is likely after death to become a <i>mas&#257;an</i> or
evil spirit. In order to avoid this contingency a bachelor who espouses
a widow in K&#257;nker is first wedded to a spear. Turmeric and oil are
rubbed on his body and on the spear, and he walks round it seven times.
Divorce is freely permitted in Chhatt&#299;sgarh at the instance of
either party and for the most trivial reasons, as a mere allegation of
disagreement; but if a husband puts away his wife when she has not been
unfaithful to him he must give her something for her support. In some
localities no ceremony is performed at all, but a wife or husband who
tires of wedlock simply leaves the other as the case may be. In Bastar
a wife cannot divorce her husband. A divorced woman does not break her
glass bangles until she marries again, when new ones are given to her
by her second husband.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A large proportion of the Halbas of Chhatt&#299;sgarh
belong to the Kab&#299;rpanthi sect. These are known as Kab&#299;rhas
and abjure the consumption of flesh and alcoholic liquor; while the
others who indulge in these articles are known as Sakatha or Sakta,
that is, a worshipper of Devi or Durga. These latter, however, also
revere all the village godlings of Chhatt&#299;sgarh.</p>

<h3 class="main">12. Disposal of the dead.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dead are always buried by the Kab&#299;rpanthis
and usually by other Halbas, cremation being reserved by the latter as
a special mark of respect for elders and heads of families. A dead body
is wrapped in a new white cloth and laid on an inverted cot. The
Kab&#299;rpanthis lay plantain leaves at the sides of the cot and over
the body to cover it. One of the mourners carries a burning cowdung
cake with the party. Before burial the thread which every male wears
round his waist is broken, the clothes are taken off the corpse and
given to a sweeper, and the body is wrapped in the shroud and laid in
the grave, salt being sprinkled under and over it. If the dead body
should be touched by any person of another caste, the deceased&rsquo;s
family has to pay a fine or give a penal caste-feast. After the
interment the mourners bathe and return to the deceased&rsquo;s house
in their wet clothes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=
"#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>Before entering it they wash their
feet in water, which is kept for that purpose at the door, and chew the
leaves of the <i>n&#299;m</i> tree (<i>Melia indica</i>). They smoke
their <i>chongis</i> or leaf-pipes and console the deceased&rsquo;s
family and then return home, washing their feet again and changing
their clothes at their own houses. On the third day, known as
<i>T&#299;j Nah&#257;n</i>, the male members of the family with the
relatives and mourners walk in Indian file to a river or tank, where
they are all shaved by the barber, the sons of the dead man or woman
having the entire head and face cleared of hair, while in the case of
other relatives, the scalp-lock and moustache may be left, and the
mourning friends are only shaved as on ordinary occasions. For his
services the barber receives a cow or a substantial cash present, which
he divides with the washerman. The latter subsequently washes all
clothes worn at the funeral and on this occasion. On the Akti festival,
or commencement of the agricultural year, libations of water and
offerings of urad<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6615src" href="#xd21e6615"
name="xd21e6615src">8</a> cakes are made to the spirits of ancestors. A
feast is given to women in honour of all departed female ancestors on
the ninth day of the Pitripaksh or mourning fortnight of Kunw&#257;r
(September), and feasts for male ancestors may be held on the same day
of the fortnight as that on which they died at any other time of the
year.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6618src" href="#xd21e6618" name=
"xd21e6618src">9</a> Such observances are practised only by the
well-to-do. Nothing is done for persons who die before their marriage
or without children, unless they trouble some member of the family and
appear in a dream to demand that these honours be paid to them. During
an epidemic of cholera all funeral and mourning ceremonies are
suspended, and a general purification of the village takes place on its
conclusion.</p>

<h3 class="main">13. Propitiating the spirits of those who have died a
violent death.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If a person has been killed by a tiger, the people go
out, and if any remains of the body are found, these are burnt on the
spot. The Baiga is then invoked to bring back the spirit of the
deceased, a most essential precaution as will shortly be seen. In order
to do this he suspends a copper ring on a long thread above a vessel of
water and then burns butter and sugar on the fire, muttering
incantations, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>while the people sing songs and call on the
spirit of the dead man to return. The thread swings to and fro, and at
length the copper ring falls into the pot, and this is taken as a sign
that the spirit has come and entered the vessel. The mouth of this is
immediately covered and it is buried or kept in some secure place. The
people believe that unless the dead man&rsquo;s spirit is secured it
will accompany the tiger and lure solitary travellers to destruction.
This is done by calling out and offering them tobacco to smoke, and
when they proceed in the direction of the voice the tiger springs out
and kills them. And they think that a tiger directed in this manner
grows fiercer and fiercer with every person whom it kills. When
somebody has been killed by a tiger the relatives will not even remove
the ornaments from the corpse, for they think that these would
constitute a link by which its spirit would cause the tiger to track
them down. The malevolence thus attributed to persons killed by tigers
is explained by their bitter wrath at having encountered such an
untimely death and consequent desire to entice others to the same.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the monthly period of menstruation women are
spoken of as &lsquo;<i>Mund maili</i>&rsquo; or having the head dirty,
and are considered to be impure for four or five days, for which time
they sleep on the ground and not on cots. In K&#257;nker they are
secluded in a separate room, and forbidden to cook or to touch the
clothes or persons of other members of the family. They must not walk
on a ploughed field, nor will the men of their family drive the plough
or sow seed during the time of their impurity. On the fifth day they
wash their heads with earth and boil their clothes in water mixed with
wood ashes. Cloth stained with the menstrual blood is usually buried
underground; if it is burnt it is supposed that the woman to whom it
belonged will become barren, and if a barren woman should swallow the
ashes of the cloth the fertility of its owner would be transferred to
her.</p>

<h3 class="main">15. Childbirth.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When pregnant women experience longings for strange
kinds of food, it is believed that these really come from the child in
the womb and must be satisfied if its development is not to be
retarded. Consequently in the fifth <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>month of a
wife&rsquo;s first pregnancy, or shortly before delivery, her mother
takes to her various kinds of rich food and feeds her with them. It is
a common custom also for pregnant women, driven by perverted appetite,
to eat earth of a clayey texture, or the ordinary black cotton soil, or
dried clay scraped off the walls of houses, or the ashes of burnt
cowdung cakes. This is done by low-caste women in most parts of the
Province, and if carried to excess leads to severe intestinal
derangement which may prove fatal. A pregnant woman must not cross a
river or eat anything with a knife, and she must observe various
precautions against the machinations of witches. At the time of
delivery the woman sits on the ground and is attended by a midwife, who
may be a Cham&#257;r, Mah&#257;r or G&#257;nda by caste. The navel cord
is burnt in the lying-in room, but the after-birth, known as Phul, is
usually buried in a rubbish pit outside the house. The portion of the
cord attached to the child&rsquo;s body is also burnt when it falls
off, but in the northern Districts it is preserved and used as a cure
for the child if it suffers from sore eyes. If a woman who has borne
only girl children can obtain the dried navel-string of a male child
and swallow it, they believe that she will have a son, and that the
mother of the boy will henceforth bear only daughters. This is the
reason why the cord is carefully secreted and not simply thrown away.
In Bastar on the sixth or naming day the female relatives and friends
of the family are invited to take food at the house. The father touches
the feet of the child with blades of <i>d&#363;b</i> grass (<i>Cynodon
dactylon</i>) steeped first in milk or melted butter, then in
sandal-paste, and finally in water, and each time passes the blade over
his head as a mark of respect. The blades of grass are afterwards
thrown over the roof of the house, so that they may not be trampled
under foot. The women guests then bring leaf-cups containing rice and a
few copper coins, which they offer to the mother, the younger ones
bowing before her with a prayer that the child may grow as old as the
speaker. All the women kiss the child, and the elder ones the mother
also. The offerings of rice and coins are taken by the midwife.</p>

<h3 class="main">16. Names.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The names of the Halbas are of the ordinary type
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>found in Chhatt&#299;sgarh, but at present they
often add the termination Sinha or Singh in imitation of the
R&#257;jp&#363;ts. Two names are sometimes given, one for daily use and
the other for comparison with that of the girl when the marriage is to
be arranged. As already seen, either the bride&rsquo;s or
bridegroom&rsquo;s name may be changed to make their union auspicious.
When a daughter-in-law comes into her husband&rsquo;s house she is
usually not called by her own name, but by some nickname or that of her
home, as Jabalpurw&#257;li, Raipurw&#257;li (she who comes from
Jabalpur or Raipur), and so on. Sometimes men of the caste are
addressed by the name of the clan or section and not by their own. A
woman must not utter the names of her husband, his parents or brothers,
nor of the sons of his elder brother and his sisters. But for these
last as well as for her own son-in-law she may invent fictitious names.
These rules she observes to show her respect for her husband&rsquo;s
relatives. A child must not be called by name at night, because if an
owl hears the name and repeats it the child will probably die. The owl
is everywhere regarded as a bird of the most evil omen. Its hoot is
unlucky, and a house in which its nest is built will be destroyed or
deserted. If it perches on the roof of a house and hoots, some one of
the family will probably fall ill, or if a member of the household is
already ill, he or she will probably die.</p>

<h3 class="main">17. Social status.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The social customs of the caste present some
differences. In Bastar, where they have a fairly high status, the
Pur&#257;it Halbas abstain from liquor, though they will eat the flesh
of clean animals and of the wild pig. The Halbas of Raipur on the other
hand, who are usually farmservants, will eat fowls, pigs and rats, and
abstain only from beef and the leavings of others. In Bastar,
Sun&#257;rs, Kurmis and castes of similar position will take water from
the hands of a Halba, and Kosaria R&#257;wats will eat all kinds of
food with them. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh the Halbas will accept water from
Telis, Kah&#257;rs and other like castes, and will also allow any of
them to become a Halba. In Chhatt&#299;sgarh they will take even food
cooked with water from the hands of a man of these castes, provided
that they are not in their own villages. These differences of custom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>are probably due to the varying social status of
the caste. In Bastar they hold land and behave accordingly, while in
Chhatt&#299;sgarh they are only labourers. They do not employ
Br&#257;hmans for ceremonial purposes but have their own caste priest,
known as Joshi, while among the Kab&#299;rpanthis the local Mahant or
Bair&#257;gi of the sect takes his place.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They have a caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee,
the headman of which is known as Kursha; he has jurisdiction over ten
or twenty villages, and is usually chosen from the Kotw&#257;r, Chanap
or N&#257;ik sections. It is the duty of the men of these sections to
scatter the <i>sonp&#257;ni</i> or &lsquo;water of gold&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6677src" href="#xd21e6677" name=
"xd21e6677src">10</a> as an act of purification over persons who have
been temporarily put out of caste for social offences. They are also
the first to eat food with such offenders on readmission to social
intercourse, and thereby take the sins of these persons upon their own
heads. In order to counteract the effect of this the purifier usually
asks three or four other men to eat with him at his own house, and
passes on a part of his burden to them. For such duties he receives a
payment of money varying from four annas to a rupee and a half. Among
the offences punished with temporary exclusion from caste are those of
rearing the lac insect and tasar silk cocoons, probably because such
work involves the killing of the insects and caterpillars which produce
the dye and silk. In Bastar a man loses his caste if he is beaten with
a shoe except by a Government servant, and is not readmitted to it. If
a man seduces a married woman and is beaten with a shoe by her husband
he is also finally expelled from caste. But happily, Mr. Panda
Baijn&#257;th remarks, shoes are very scarce in the State, and hence
such cases do not often arise. They never yoke cows to the plough as
other castes do in Bastar, nor do they tie up two cows with the same
rope.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dress of the Halbas, as of other Chhatt&#299;sgarh
castes, is scanty, and most of them have only a short cloth about the
loins and another round the shoulders. They dispense with both shoes
and head-cloth, but every man must have a thread tied round his waist.
To this thread in former times, Colonel Dalton remarks, the apron of
leaves was not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>improbably suspended. The women do not wear
nose-rings, spangles on the forehead or rings on the toes; but girl
children have the left nostril pierced, and this must always be done on
the full moon day of the month of P&#363;s (December). A copper ring is
inserted in the nostril and worn for a few months, but must be removed
before the girl&rsquo;s marriage. A married woman has a cloth over her
head, and smears vermilion on the parting of her hair and also on her
forehead. An unmarried girl may have the copper ring already mentioned,
and may place a dab of vermilion on her forehead, but must not smear it
on the parting of her hair. She goes bare-headed till marriage, as is
the custom in Chhatt&#299;sgarh. A widow should not have vermilion on
her face at all, nor should she use glass bangles or ornaments about
the ankles. She may have a string of glass beads about her neck. A
woman&rsquo;s cloth is usually white with a broad red border all round
it. The Gonds and Halbas tie the cloth round the waist and carry the
slack end from the left side behind up the back and over the head and
right shoulder; while women of higher castes take the cloth from the
right side over the head and left shoulder.</p>

chin, and three dots in a line on the right shoulder. A girl is again
tattooed after marriage, but before leaving for her husband&rsquo;s
house. On this occasion four pairs of parallel lines are made on the
leg above the ankle, in front, behind, and on the sides. As a rule, the
legs are not otherwise tattooed, nor the trunk of the body. Groups of
dots, triangles and lines are made on the arms, and on the left arm is
pricked a zigzag line known as the <i>sikri</i> or chain, the pattern
of which is distinctive. Teli and Gahra (Ah&#299;r) women also have the
<i>sikri</i>, but in a slightly different form. The tattooing is done
by a woman of the Dewar caste, and she receives some corn and the cloth
worn by the girl at the time of the operation. If a child is slow in
learning to walk they tattoo it on the loins above the hips, and
believe that this is efficacious. Men who suffer from rheumatism also
get the affected joints tattooed, and are said to experience much
relief. The tattooing acts no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201"
href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>doubt as a blister, and may
produce a temporarily beneficial effect. It may be compared to the
bee-sting cure for rheumatism now advocated in England. Tattooing is
believed to enhance the beauty of women, and it is also said that the
tattoo marks are the only ornament which will accompany the soul to the
other world. From this belief it seems clear that they expect to have
the same body in the after-life.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nearly all the Halbas are now engaged in agriculture
as tenants and labourers. Seven zam&#299;nd&#257;ri estates are held by
members of the caste, six in Bhand&#257;ra and one in Ch&#257;nda, and
they also have some villages in the south of the Raipur and Dr&#363;g
Districts. It is probable that they obtained this property in reward
for military service, at the period when they were employed in the
armies of the Ratanpur kings and of the Gond dynasty of Ch&#257;nda. In
the forest tracts of Dhamtari they are considered the best cultivators
next to the Telis, and they show themselves quite able to hold their
own in the open country, where their villages are usually prosperous.
In Bastar they still practise shifting cultivation, sowing their crops
on burnt-out patches of forest. Though hunting is not now one of their
regular occupations, Mr. Gokul Pras&#257;d describes them as catching
game by the following method: Six or seven men go out together at
night, tying round their feet <i>ghunghunias</i> or two small hollow
balls of brass with stones inside which tinkle as they move, such as
are worn by postal runners. They move in Indian file, the first man
carrying a lantern and the others walking behind him in its shadow.
They walk with measured tread, and the <i>ghunghunias</i> give out a
rhythmical harmonious sound. Hares and other small animals are
attracted by the sound, and at the same time half-blinded by the light,
so that they do not see the line of men. They approach, and are knocked
over or caught by the men following the leader.</p>

<h2 class="main">Halwai</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Halwai.</b>&mdash;The occupational caste of
confectioners, numbering about 3000 persons in the Central Provinces
and Ber&#257;r in 1911. The Halwai takes his name from <i>halwa</i>, a
sweet made of flour, clarified butter and sugar, coloured with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>saffron and flavoured with almonds, raisins and
pistachio-nuts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6725src" href="#xd21e6725"
name="xd21e6725src">1</a> The caste gives no account of its origin in
northern India, but it is clearly a functional group composed of
members of respectable middle-class castes who adopted the profession
of sweetmeat-making. The Halwais are also called Mithaihas, or
preparers of sweets, and in the Uriya country are known as Guria from
<i>gur</i> or unrefined sugar. The caste has several subdivisions with
territorial names, generally derived from places in northern India, as
Kanaujia from Kanauj, and Jaunpuria from Jaunpur; others are
K&#257;ndu, a grain-parcher, and Dobisya, meaning two score. One of the
Guria subdivisions is named Haldia from <i>haldi</i>, turmeric, and
members of this subcaste are employed to prepare the
<i>mah&#257;pras&#257;d</i> or cooked rice which is served at the
temple of Jagann&#257;th and which is eaten by all castes together
without scruple. The Gurias have exogamous divisions or <i>bargas</i>,
the names of which are generally functional, as Darb&#257;n,
door-keeper; Sar&#257;f, treasurer; Bhitarya, one who looks to
household affairs, and others. Marriage within the <i>barga</i> is
forbidden, but the union of first cousins is not prohibited. Marriage
may be infant or adult. A girl who has a <i>liaison</i> with a man of
the caste may be wedded to him by the form used for the remarriage of a
widow, but if she goes wrong with an outsider she is finally expelled.
Widow-marriage is allowed, and divorce may be effected for misconduct
on the part of the wife.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Halwai or confectioner&rsquo;s shop</p>
</div>
<p>The social standing of the Halwai is respectable. &ldquo;His
art,&rdquo; says Mr. Nesfield,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6754src"
href="#xd21e6754" name="xd21e6754src">2</a> &ldquo;implies rather an
advanced state of culture, and hence his rank in the social scale is a
high one. There is no caste in India which considers itself too pure to
eat what a confectioner has made. In marriage banquets it is he who
supplies a large part of the feast, and at all times and seasons the
sweetmeat is a favourite food to a Hindu requiring a temporary
refreshment. There is a kind of bread called <i>puri</i>, consisting of
wheaten dough fried in melted butter, which is taken as a substitute
for the <i>chap&#257;ti</i> or wheaten pancake by travellers and others
who happen to be unable to have their bread cooked at their own fire,
and is made by the Halwais.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203"
href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p>The real reason why the Halwai occupies a good position perhaps
simply results from the necessity that other castes should be able to
take cakes from him. Among the higher castes food cooked with water
should not be eaten except at the hearth after this has been specially
cleansed and spread with cowdung, and those who are to eat have bathed
and otherwise purified themselves. But as the need continuously arises
for travellers and others to take a meal abroad where they cannot cook
it for themselves, sweetmeats and cakes made without water are
permitted to be eaten in this way, and the Halwai, as the purveyor of
these, has been given the position of a pure caste from whose hands a
Br&#257;hman can take water. In a similar manner, water may be taken
from the hands of the Dh&#299;mar who is a household servant, the
Kah&#257;r or palanquin-bearer, the Barai or betel-leaf seller, and the
Bharbh&#363;nja or rice-parcher, although some of these castes have a
very low origin and occupy the humble position of menial servants.</p>
<p>The Halwai&rsquo;s shop is one of the most familiar in an Indian
baz&#257;r, and in towns a whole row of them may be seen together, this
arrangement being doubtless adopted for the social convenience of the
caste-fellows, though it might be expected to decrease the custom that
they receive. His wares consist of trays full of white and
yellow-coloured sweetmeats and cakes of flour and sugar, very
unappetising to a European eye, though Hindu boys show no lack of
appreciation of them. The Hindus are very fond of sweet things, which
is perhaps a common trait of an uneducated palate. Hindu children will
say that such sweets as chocolate almonds are too bitter, and their
favourite drink, sherbet, is simply a mixture of sugar and water with
some flavouring, and seems scarcely calculated to quench the thirst
produced by an Indian hot weather. Similarly their tea is so sweetened
with sugar and spices as to be distasteful to a European.</p>
<p>The ingredients of a Halwai&rsquo;s sweets are wheat and gram-flour,
milk and country sugar. Those called <i>bat&#257;shas</i> consist
merely of syrup of sugar boiled with a little flour, which is taken out
in spoonfuls and allowed to cool. They are very easy to make and are
commonly distributed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>schoolboys on any occasion of
importance, and are something like a meringue in composition. The kind
called <i>barafi</i> or ice is made from thick boiled milk mixed with
sugar, and is more expensive and considered more of a treat than
<i>bat&#257;shas</i>. <i>Laddus</i> are made from gram-flour which is
mixed with water and dropped into boiling butter, when it hardens into
lumps. These are taken out and dipped in syrup of sugar and allowed to
cool. <i>Pheni</i> is a thin strip of dough of fine wheat-flour fried
in butter and then dipped in syrup of sugar. Other sweets are made from
the flour of <i>sing&#257;ra</i> or water-nut and from <i>chironji</i>,
the kernel of the <i>ach&#257;r</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e6798src"
href="#xd21e6798" name="xd21e6798src">3</a> nut, coated with sugar. Of
ordinary sweets the cheaper kinds cost 8 annas a seer of 2 lb. and the
more expensive ones 10 or 12 annas. Sweets prepared by Bengali
confectioners are considered the best of all. The Halwai sits on a
board in his shop surrounded by wooden trays of the different kinds of
sweets. These are often covered with crowds of flies and in some places
with a variety of formidable-looking hornets. The latter do not appear
to be vicious, however, and when he wishes to take sweets off a tray
the Halwai whisks them off with a palm-leaf brush. Only if one of them
gets into his cloth, or he unguardedly pushes his hand down into a heap
of sweets and encounters a hornet, he may receive a sting of which the
mark remains for some time. The better-class confectioners now imitate
English sweets, and at fairs when they retail boiled grain and
<i>gh&#299;</i> they provide spoons and little basins for their
customers.</p>

small caste of Ber&#257;r, numbering about 14,000 persons in 1911. They
are found principally in the Pusad t&#257;luk of Yeotm&#257;l District,
their villages being placed like a line of outposts along the
Hyder&#257;b&#257;d border. The Hatkars are a branch of the Dhangar or
shepherd caste, and in some localities they are considered as a
subcaste of Dhangars. The derivation of the name Hatkar is obscure, but
the Hatkars appear to be those Dhangars who first took to military
service under Sivaji and hence became a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>distinct group.
&ldquo;Undisciplined, often unarmed, men of the M&#257;wals or mountain
valleys above the Ghauts who were called M&#257;wallees, and of those
below the mountains towards the sea, called Hetkurees, joined the young
leader.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6826src" href="#xd21e6826"
name="xd21e6826src">2</a> The Hatkars were thus the soldiers of the
Konkan in Sivaji&rsquo;s army. The <i>Ain-i-Akbari</i> states that the
Hatkars were driven westward across the Wardha by the Gonds. At this
time (<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1600) they were holding the country
round B&#257;sim by force of arms, and are described as a refractory
and perfidious race.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6839src" href=

are all Bargi or Bangi Dhangars, the shepherds with the spears. They
say that formerly when going on any expedition they took only a blanket
seven cubits long and a bear-spear. They would appear to have been all
footmen. The N&#257;iks or village headman of B&#257;sim were
principally Hatkars. The duty of a N&#257;ik was to maintain order and
stop robbery; but in time they became law-breakers and their men the
dacoits of the country. Some of them were very powerful, and in 1818
Nows&#257;ji N&#257;ik&rsquo;s troops gave battle to the
Niz&#257;m&rsquo;s regular forces under Major Pitman before Umarkhar.
He was beaten and sent to Hyder&#257;b&#257;d, where he died, and the
power of the N&#257;iks was broken by Major Sutherland. He hanged so
many that the N&#257;iks pronounce his name to this day with awe. To
some of the N&#257;iks he gave money and told them to settle down in
certain villages. Others who also came, expecting money, were at once
hanged.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6847src" href="#xd21e6847"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Hatkars are also called Bangi Dhangars, and in
Ber&#257;r rank above other Dhangars because they took to soldiering
and obtained grants of land, just as the Mar&#257;thas rank above the
Kunbis. Another group have given up sheep-tending and keep cattle,
which is a more respectable occupation on account of the sanctity of
cattle, and these call themselves Gauli Hatkars. These Gauli Hatkars
have given up drinking liquor and eating fowls. They will not touch or
sell the milk of buffaloes and cows before sunset on Mondays, the day
on which they worship Krishna. If <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206"
href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>any one is in need of milk on
that day they will let him milk the animal himself, but will take no
price for the milk. On a Monday also they will not give fire from their
house to any member of a low caste, such as a Mah&#257;r. On the day of
Diw&#257;li they worship their cows, tying a bunch of wool to the
animal&rsquo;s forehead and putting rice on it; they make a mud image
of Govardhan, the mountain held up by Krishna as an umbrella to protect
the people from the rain, and then let the cows trample it to pieces
with their hoofs. If a bullock dies with the rope halter through its
nose, the owner is put out of caste; this rule also obtains among the
Ah&#299;rs and Gaulis, and is perhaps responsible for the objection
felt in some localities to putting string through the nostrils of
plough- and cart-bullocks, though it is the only means of obtaining any
control over them.</p>

class of eunuchs, who form a separate community, recruited by the
admission of persons born with this deformity or reduced to the like
condition by amputation. In Saugor it is said that the Khasuas are
natural and the Hijras artificial eunuchs, and the Khasuas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>deny
that they admit Hijras into their society. They may be either Hindus or
Muhammadans by birth, but all become Muhammadans. Children born in the
condition of eunuchs are usually made over to the Khasuas by their
parents. The caste are beggars, and also sing and dance at weddings and
at the births of male children, and obtain presents of grain from the
cultivators at seedtime and harvest. They wear female clothes and
ornaments and assume the names of women. They are admitted to mosques,
but have to stand behind the women, and in Saugor they have their own
mosque. They observe Muhammadan rites and festivals generally, and are
permitted to smoke from the huqqas of other Muhammadans. They are
governed by a caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee, which imposes
fines but does not expel any member from the community. Each Khasua has
a beat or locality reserved to him for begging and no other may
infringe on it, violations of this rule being punished by the
committee. Sometimes a well-to-do Khasua adopts an orphan and
celebrates the child&rsquo;s marriage with as much expense and display
as he can afford, and the K&#257;zi officiates at the ceremony.</p>
<p>The Hijras form apparently a separate group, and the following
account of them is mainly taken from the <i>Bombay
Gazetteer</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6891src" href="#xd21e6891"
name="xd21e6891src">2</a> In Gujar&#257;t they are the emasculated male
votaries of the goddess Bouchera or Behechra, a sister of Devi. She is
the spirit of a martyred Ch&#257;ran or Bh&#257;t woman. Some
Ch&#257;ran women were travelling from Sulkhunpur in Gujar&#257;t when
they were attacked and plundered by Kolis. One of the women, of the
name of Bouchera, snatched a sword from a boy who attended her and with
it cut off both her breasts. She immediately perished, and was deified
and worshipped as a form of Devi in the Chunw&#257;l.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6896src" href="#xd21e6896" name="xd21e6896src">3</a> The
Hijras usually mutilate themselves in the performance of a religious
vow, sometimes taken by the mother as a means of obtaining children,
and in rare cases by the boy himself to obtain recovery by the favour
of the goddess from a dangerous illness.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6901src" href="#xd21e6901" name="xd21e6901src">4</a> Hence it is
clear that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>they worship Boucheraji on the ground that she
obtained divine honours by self-mutilation and should enable her
votaries to do the same. But the real reason for the Ch&#257;ran woman
cutting off her breasts was no doubt that her ghost might haunt and
destroy the Koli robbers, in accordance with the usual practice of the
Ch&#257;rans.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6910src" href="#xd21e6910"
name="xd21e6910src">5</a> As a further fulfilment of their vow the
Hijras pull out the hair of their beards and moustaches, bore their
ears and noses for female ornaments, and affect female speech and
manners. The meaning of the vow would appear to be that the mother
sacrifices her great blessing of a boy child and transforms him after a
fashion into a girl, at the same time devoting him to the service of
the goddess. Similarly, as a much milder form of the same idea, a
mother whose sons have died will sometimes bore the nose of a
later-born son and put a small nose-ring in it to make believe he is a
girl. But in this case the aim is also partly to cheat the goddess or
the evil spirits who cause the death of children, and make them think
the boy is a girl and therefore not worth taking.</p>
<p>The rite of mutilation is described by Mr. Far&#299;di as follows:
&ldquo;The initiation takes place at the temple of the goddess Behechra
about 60 miles from Ahmad&#257;b&#257;d, where the neophyte repairs
under the guardianship or adoption of some older member of the
brotherhood. The lad is called the daughter of the old Hijra his
guardian. The emasculation is a secret rite and takes place under the
direction of the chief Hijra priest of Behechra. It is said that the
operation and initiation are held in a house with closed doors, where
all the Hijras meet in holiday dress. A special dish of fried pastry is
cooked, and the neophyte is bathed, dressed in red female attire,
decked with flower-garlands and seated on a stool in the middle of the
room, while the others sing to the accompaniment of a small drum and
copper cymbals. Another room is prepared for the operation, soft ashes
being spread on the floor and piled in a heap in the centre. When the
time for the operation approaches, the neophyte is led to the room and
is made to lie on his back on the ash-heap. The operator approaches
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>chewing betel-leaf. The hands and legs of the
neophyte are firmly held by some one of the fraternity, and the
operator, carelessly standing near with an unconcerned air, when he
finds the attention of his patient otherwise occupied, with great
dexterity and with one stroke completely cuts off the genital organs.
He spits betel and areca juice on the wound and staunches the bleeding
with a handful of the ashes of the <i>bab&#363;l</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6920src" href="#xd21e6920" name="xd21e6920src">6</a> The
operation is dangerous and not uncommonly fatal.&rdquo; Another method
is to hold the organs in a cleft bamboo and slice them off. The Hijras
are beggars like the Khasuas, and sometimes become very importunate.
Soon after the birth of a child in Gujar&#257;t the hated Hijras or
eunuchs crowd round the house for gifts. If the demand of one of them
is refused the whole rank and file of the local fraternity besiege the
house with indecent clamour and gesture. Their claim to alms rests, as
with other religious mendicants, in the sacred character which attaches
to them. In Bombay there is also a belief that the god Hanum&#257;n
cries out once in twelve years, and that those men who hear him are
transformed into eunuchs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6924src" href=
"#xd21e6924" name="xd21e6924src">7</a> Some of them make money by
allowing spectators to look at the mutilated part of their body, and
also by the practice of pederasty.</p>
<p>Homosexual practices are believed to be distinctly rare among
Hindus, and not common among Muhammadans of the Central Provinces. For
this the early age of marriage may probably be considered a principal
cause. The Hindu sacred books, however, do not attach severe penalties
to this offence. &ldquo;According to the Laws of Manu, a twice-born man
who commits an unnatural offence with a male, or has intercourse with a
female in a cart drawn by oxen, in water or in the daytime, shall
bathe, dressed in his clothes; and all these are reckoned as minor
offences.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6932src" href="#xd21e6932"
name="xd21e6932src">8</a> In his <i>Origin and Development of the Moral
Ideas</i> Dr. Westermarck shows that, apart from the genuine cases of
sexual perversion, as to the frequency of which opinions differ,
homosexual love frequently arises in three conditions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>of
society. These are, when women are actually scarce, as among the
Australian aborigines and other primitive races; when the men are
frequently engaged in war or in predatory expeditions and are separated
from their wives for long periods, a condition which accounts for its
prevalence among the Sikhs and Path&#257;ns; and lastly, when women are
secluded and uneducated and hence their society affords little
intellectual pleasure to men. This was the case in ancient Greece where
women received no education and had no place at the public spectacles
which were the chief means of culture;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6945src" href="#xd21e6945" name="xd21e6945src">9</a> and the same
reason probably accounts for the frequency of the vice among the
Persians and modern Egyptians. &ldquo;So also it seems that the
ignorance and dulness of Muhammadan women, which is a result of their
total lack of education and their secluded life, is a cause of
homosexual practices; Moors are sometimes heard to defend pederasty on
the plea that the company of boys, who have always news to tell, is so
much more entertaining than the company of women.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6951src" href="#xd21e6951" name=
"xd21e6951src">10</a></p>
<p>The Christian Church in this as in other respects has set a very
high standard of sexual morality. Unnatural crimes were regarded with
peculiar horror in the Middle Ages, and the punishments for them in
English law were burying and burning alive, though these were probably
seldom or never enforced.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6958src" href=
"#xd21e6958" name="xd21e6958src">11</a> The attitude of the Church,
which was reflected in the civil law, was partly inherited from the
Jews of the Old Testament, and reinforced by similar conditions in
mediaeval society. In both cases this crime was especially associated
with the heathen and heretics, as shown in Dr. Westermarck&rsquo;s
interesting account:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6963src" href=
"#xd21e6963" name="xd21e6963src">12</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;According to Genesis, unnatural vice was the sin of a people
who were not the Lord&rsquo;s people, and the Levitical legislation
represents Canaanitish abominations as the chief reason why the
Canaanites were exterminated. Now we know that sodomy entered as an
element in their religion. Besides <i>ked&#275;sh&#333;th</i>, or
female prostitutes, there were <i>ked&#275;sh&#299;m</i> or male
prostitutes, attached to their temples. The word <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span><i>k&#257;d&#275;sh</i>, translated
&lsquo;Sodomite,&rsquo; properly denotes a man dedicated to a deity;
and it appears that such men were consecrated to the mother of the
gods, the famous Dea Syria, whose priests or devotees they were
considered to be. The male devotees of this and other goddesses were
probably in a position analogous to that occupied by the female
devotees of certain gods, who also, as we have seen, have developed
into libertines; and the sodomitic acts committed with these temple
prostitutes may, like the connections with priestesses, have had in
view to transfer blessings to the worshippers. In Morocco supernatural
benefits are expected not only from heterosexual, but also from
homosexual intercourse with a holy person. The
<i>ked&#275;sh&#299;m</i> are frequently alluded to in the Old
Testament, especially in the period of the monarchy, when rites of
foreign origin made their way into both Israel and Judah. And it is
natural that the Y&#257;hveh worshipper should regard their practices
with the utmost horror as forming part of an idolatrous cult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hebrew conception of homosexual love to some extent
affected Muhammadanism, and passed into Christianity. The notion that
it is a form of sacrilege was here strengthened by the habits of the
Gentiles. St. Paul found the abominations of Sodom prevalent among
nations who had &lsquo;changed the truth of God into a lie, and
worshipped and served the creature more than the creator.&rsquo; During
the Middle Ages heretics were accused of unnatural vice as a matter of
course. Indeed, so closely was sodomy associated with heresy that the
same name was applied to both. In <i lang="fr">La Coutume de
Touraine-Anjou</i> the word <i lang="fr">h&eacute;rite</i>, which is
the ancient form of <i lang="fr">h&eacute;r&eacute;tique</i>, seems to
be used in the sense of &lsquo;sodomite&rsquo;; and the French <i lang=
"fr">bougre</i> (from the Latin <i>Bulgarus</i>, Bulgarian), as also
its English synonym, was originally a name given to a sect of heretics
who came from Bulgaria in the eleventh century and was afterwards
applied to other heretics, but at the same time it became the regular
expression for a person guilty of unnatural intercourse. In mediaeval
laws sodomy was also repeatedly mentioned together with heresy, and the
punishment was the same for both. It thus remained a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>religious offence of the first order. It was not
only a &lsquo;<span lang="la">vitium nefandum et super omnia
detestandum</span>,&rsquo; but it was one of the four
&lsquo;<span lang="la">clamantia peccata</span>,&rsquo; or crying sins,
a &lsquo;<span lang="fr">crime de Majestie, vers le Roy
celestre.</span>&rsquo; Very naturally, therefore, it has come to be
regarded with somewhat greater leniency by law and public opinion in
proportion as they have emancipated themselves from theological
doctrines. And the fresh light which the scientific study of the sexual
impulse has lately thrown upon the subject of homosexuality must also
necessarily influence the moral ideas relating to it, in so far as no
scrutinising judge can fail to take into account the pressure which a
powerful non-volitional desire exercises upon an agent&rsquo;s
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first"><b>Holia.</b><a class="noteref" id="xd21e7018src"
href="#xd21e7018" name="xd21e7018src">1</a>&mdash;A low caste of
drummers and leather-workers who claim to be degraded Golars or Telugu
Ah&#299;rs, under which caste most of the Holias seem to have returned
themselves in 1901.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7021src" href=
"#xd21e7021" name="xd21e7021src">2</a> The Holias relate the following
story of their origin. Once upon a time two brothers, Golar by caste,
set out in search of service, having with them a bullock. On the way
the elder brother went to worship his tutelary deity Holi&#257;ri Deva;
but while he was doing so the bullock accidentally died, and the
ceremony could not be proceeded with until the carcase was removed.
Neither a Cham&#257;r nor anybody else could be got to do this, so at
length the younger brother was prevailed upon by the elder one to take
away the body. When he returned, the elder brother would not touch him,
saying that he had lost his caste. The younger brother resigned himself
to his fate and called himself Holu, after the god whom he had been
worshipping at the time he lost his caste. His descendants were named
Holias. But he prayed to the god to avenge him for the treachery of his
brother, and from that moment misfortunes commenced to shower upon the
Golar until he repented and made what reparation he could; and in
memory of this, whenever a Golar dies, the Holias are feasted by the
other Golars to the present day. The story indicates a connection
between the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>castes, and it is highly probable that the
Holias are a degraded class of Golars who took to the trade of tanning
and leather-working. When a Holia goes to a Golar&rsquo;s house he must
be asked to come in and sit down or the Golar will be put out of caste;
and when a Golar dies the house must be purified by a Holia. The caste
is a very numerous one in Madras. Here the Holia is superior only to
the M&#257;diga or Cham&#257;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7026src"
href="#xd21e7026" name="xd21e7026src">3</a> In the Central Provinces
they are held to be impure and to rank below the Mah&#257;rs, and they
live on the outskirts of the village. Their caste customs resemble
generally those of the Golars. They believe their traditional
occupation to be the playing of leathern drums, and they still follow
this trade, and also make slippers and leather thongs for agricultural
purposes. But they must not make or mend shoes on pain of
excommunication from caste. They are of middle stature, dark in colour,
and very dirty in their person and habits. Like the Golars, the Holias
speak a dialect of Canarese, which is known as Golari, Holia or Komtau.
Mr. Thurston gives the following interesting particulars about the
Holias:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7031src" href="#xd21e7031" name=
"xd21e7031src">4</a> &ldquo;If a man of another caste enters the house
of a Mysore Holia, the owner takes care to tear the intruder&rsquo;s
cloth, and turn him out. This will avert any evil which might have
befallen him. It is said that Br&#257;hmans consider great luck will
wait upon them if they can manage to pass through a Holia village
unmolested. Should a Br&#257;hman attempt to enter their quarters, the
Holias turn him out, and slipper him, in former times it is said to
death.&rdquo;</p>

"xd21e7045src" href="#xd21e7045" name="xd21e7045src">1</a>&mdash;A
caste of agricultural labourers and fishermen found in the Mar&#257;tha
tract of the Wainganga Valley, comprised in the Bhand&#257;ra and
B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t Districts. In 1901 they numbered 8500 persons
as against 11,000 in 1891. The name Injhw&#257;r is simply a
Mar&#257;thi corruption of Binjhw&#257;r, as <i>&#299;s</i> for
<i>b&#299;s</i> (twenty) and Ithoba for Bithoba or Vithoba. In his
Census Report of 1891 Sir Benjamin Robertson remarked that the name was
often entered in the census books as Vinjhw&#257;r, and in Mar&#257;thi
<i>B</i> and <i>V</i> are practically <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>interchangeable. The
Injhw&#257;rs are thus a caste formed from the Binjhw&#257;rs or
highest subdivision of the Baiga tribe of B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t; they
have adopted the social customs of the Mar&#257;thi-speaking people
among whom they live, and have been formed into a separate caste
through a corruption of their name. They still worship Injha or Vindhya
Devi, the tutelary deity of the Vindhyan hills, from which the name of
the Binjhw&#257;rs is derived. The Injhw&#257;rs have also some
connection with the Gow&#257;ri or cowherd caste of the Mar&#257;tha
country. They are sometimes known as D&#363;dh-Gow&#257;ri, and say
that this is because an Injhw&#257;r woman was a wet-nurse of the
first-born Gow&#257;ri. The Gow&#257;ris themselves, as a low caste of
herdsmen frequenting the jungles, would naturally be brought into close
connection with both the Baigas and Gonds. Their alliances with the
Gonds have produced the distinct caste of Gond-Gow&#257;ri, and it is
not improbable that one fact operating to separate the Injhw&#257;rs
from their parent tribe of the Baigas was an admixture of Gow&#257;ri
blood. But they rank higher than the Gond-Gow&#257;ris, who are
regarded as impure; this is probably on account of the superior
position of the Binjhw&#257;rs, who form the aristocracy of the Baiga
tribe, and, living in the forests, were never reduced to the menial and
servile condition imposed on the Gond residents in Hindu villages. The
Injhw&#257;rs, however, admit the superiority of the Gow&#257;ris by
taking food from their hands, a favour which the latter will not
reciprocate. Several of the sept or family names of the caste are also
taken from the Gonds, and this shows an admixture of Gond blood; the
Injhw&#257;rs are thus probably a mixed group of Gonds, Gow&#257;ris,
and Binjhw&#257;rs or Baigas.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Subdivisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Injhw&#257;rs have four subcastes, three of the
territorial and one of the occupational class. These are the
L&#257;njiw&#257;r, or those living round L&#257;nji in
B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t; the Korre, or those of the Korai hill tract in
Seoni; the Ch&#257;ndew&#257;r or Mar&#257;tha Injhw&#257;rs who belong
to Ch&#257;nda, and are distinguished by holding their weddings only in
the evening after the Mar&#257;tha custom, while other Injhw&#257;rs
will perform the ceremony at any time of day; and the Sonjharias, or
those who have taken to washing for gold in the beds of streams. Of
their sept or family names some, as already stated, are taken from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>the Gonds, as Mesr&#257;m, Tek&#257;m, Marai,
Ukya.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7070src" href="#xd21e7070" name=
"xd21e7070src">2</a> Three names, Bhoyar, Kawara and Kohrya (from
Kohli), are the names of other castes or tribes, and indicate that
members of these became Injhw&#257;rs and founded families; and others
are of the territorial, titular and totemistic types. Among them may be
mentioned the P&#299;thv&#257;ly&#257;s, from <i>p&#299;th</i>, flour;
all families of this sept should steal a little rice from somebody
else&rsquo;s field as soon as it is ripe, husband and wife making a
joint expedition for the purpose. They must not speak a word to each
other from the time they start until they have brought back the rice,
pounded and cooked it, offered it to the god and made their meal. The
Paunpats, named after the lotus, will not touch the flowers or leaves
of the lotus plants, or even drink water from a tank in which the lotus
grows. The Dobokria R&#257;wats are so named because they make an
offering of two goats to their gods. Some of the septs are subdivided.
Thus the Sonw&#257;ni or gold-water sept, whose members readmit social
culprits, is divided into the Paunpat or lotus Sonw&#257;nis; the
Gurhiw&#257;l, who revere a brass vessel tied to a bamboo on the first
day of the year; the Sati Sonw&#257;ni, who worship the spirit of a
<i>sati</i> woman ancestor; and the M&#363;ngph&#257;tia Sonw&#257;nis,
whose token is the broken <i>mung</i> pulse. At present these subsepts
cannot intermarry, the union of any two Sonw&#257;nis being forbidden,
but it seems likely that intermarriage may be permitted in the course
of time.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Marriage and other customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The social customs of the Injhw&#257;rs resemble those
of the lower Mar&#257;tha castes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7087src"
href="#xd21e7087" name="xd21e7087src">3</a> Marriage is forbidden
between members of the same sept and first cousins, and a man should
also not take a wife from the sept of his brother or sister-in-law.
This rule prevents the marriage of two brothers to two sisters, to
which there is of course no objection on the ground of affinity. Girls
are usually not married until they are grown up; but in places where
they have been much subjected to Hindu influences, the Injhw&#257;rs
will sometimes wed an adult girl to a basil plant in order to avoid the
stigma of keeping her in the house unmarried. The boy&rsquo;s father
goes to make a proposal of marriage, and the girl&rsquo;s father, if he
approves it, intimates his consent by washing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>his
visitor&rsquo;s feet. A bride-price of about Rs. 20 is usually paid,
which is increased somewhat if the bridegroom is a widower, and
decreased if the bride has been seduced before marriage. The marriage
is performed by throwing coloured rice over the couple. Divorce and the
remarriage of widows are permitted. A bachelor who marries a widow must
first go through the ceremony with an <i>arka</i> or swallow-wort
plant, this being considered his real marriage. The Injhw&#257;rs
usually bury the dead, and in accordance with Dravidian custom place
the corpse in the grave with the feet to the north. When the body is
that of a young girl, the face is left exposed as it is carried to the
grave. The regular ceremonies are performed for the welfare of the
deceased&rsquo;s soul, and they try to ascertain its fate in the next
incarnation by spreading flour on the ground overnight and looking in
the morning for anything resembling the foot-mark of a human being,
animal or bird. On the festival of Akh&#257;t&#299;j and in the month
of K&#257;rtik (October) they offer libations to the dead, setting out
a large pitcher of water for a male and a small one for a female. On
the former they paint five lines of sandalwood to represent a
man&rsquo;s caste-mark, and on the latter five splashes of <i>kunku</i>

cultivators, while the Sonjharias wash for gold. The women of the
Mar&#257;tha or Ch&#257;ndew&#257;r subcaste serve as midwives. Their
social status is low, and in the forest tracts they will eat snakes and
crocodiles, and in fact almost anything except beef. They will admit
members of the Br&#257;hman, Dh&#299;mar (waterman), M&#257;li and
Gow&#257;ri castes into the community on payment of a premium of five
to fifteen rupees and a dinner to the caste-fellows. The candidate for
admission, whether male or female, must have his head shaved clean.
Both men and women can obtain pardon for a <i>liaison</i> with an
outsider belonging to any except the most impure castes by giving a
feast to the community. To be beaten with a shoe involves temporary
excommunication from caste, unless the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first"><b>J&#257;dam.</b><a class="noteref" id="xd21e7114src"
href="#xd21e7114" name="xd21e7114src">1</a>&mdash;A branch of the
well-known Y&#257;du or Y&#257;dava sept of R&#257;jp&#363;ts which has
now developed into a caste in the Nerbudda valley. Colonel Tod
describes the Y&#257;du as the most illustrious of all the tribes of
India, this name having been borne by the descendants of Buddha,
progenitor of the Lunar race. The Y&#257;davas were the herdsmen of
Mathura, and Krishna was born in this tribe. His son was Bh&#257;rat,
from whom the classical name of Bh&#257;ratav&#257;rsha for India is
held to be derived. It is related that when Krishna was about to ascend
to heaven, he reflected that the Y&#257;davas had multiplied
exceedingly and would probably cause trouble to the world after he had
left it. So he decided to reduce their numbers, and one day he
persuaded one of his companions to dress up as a pregnant woman in
jest, and they took him to the hermitage of the saint Durv&#257;sa and
asked the saint to what the woman would give birth. Durv&#257;sa, who
was of a very irascible temper, divined that he was being trifled with,
and replied that a rice-pestle would be born by which the Y&#257;davas
would be destroyed. On the return of the party they found to their
astonishment that a pestle had actually, as it were, been born from the
man. So they were alarmed at the words of the saint and tried to
destroy the pestle by rubbing it on a stone. But as the sawdust of the
pestle fell on the ground there sprang up from it the shoots of the
Gondla or Elephant grass, which grows taller than the head of a man on
horseback. And some time afterwards a quarrel arose among the
Y&#257;davas, and they tore up the stalks of this grass and slew each
other with it. Only one woman escaped, whose son was afterwards the
King of Mathura and the ancestor of the existing tribe. Another body,
however, with whom was Krishna, fled to Gujar&#257;t, and on the coast
there built the great temple of Dw&#257;rka, in the place known as
Jagat Khant, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>or the World&rsquo;s End. The story has some
resemblance to that of the sowing of the dragon&rsquo;s teeth by Cadmus
at Thebes. The principal branches of the Y&#257;davas are the
Y&#257;duvansi chiefs of Karauli, in R&#257;jput&#257;na, and the
Bhatti chiefs of Jaisalmer. The J&#257;dams of Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d
say that they immigrated from Karauli State about 700 years ago, having
come to the country on a foray for plunder and afterwards settled here.
They have now developed into a caste, marrying among themselves. In
Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d the caste has two subdivisions, the Kachhotia who
belong principally to the Soh&#257;gpur tahs&#299;l, and the Adhodias
who live in Seoni and Harda. These two groups are endogamous and do not
marry with each other. The Kachhotia are the offspring of irregular
unions and are looked down upon by the others. They say that they have
fifty-two exogamous groups or sections, but this number is used locally
as an expression of indefinite magnitude. All the sections appear to be
named after villages where their ancestors once lived, but the
preference for totemism has led some of the groups to connect their
names with natural objects. Thus the designation of the Semaria section
may be held to be derived from a village of that name, both on account
of its form, and because the other known section-names are taken from
villages. But the Semaria J&#257;dams have adopted the <i>semar</i> or
cotton-tree as their totem and pay reverence to this.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7122src" href="#xd21e7122" name="xd21e7122src">2</a></p>
<p>Infant-marriage is favoured in the caste, and polygamy is also
prevalent. This is often the case among the agricultural castes, where
a man will marry several wives in order to obtain their assistance in
his cultivation, a wife being a more industrious and reliable worker
than a hired servant. No penalty is, however, imposed for allowing a
girl to reach adolescence before marriage, and this not infrequently
happens. If a girl becomes with child through a man of the caste she is
united to him by a simple rite known as <i>gunda</i>, in which she
merely gives him a ring or throws a garland of flowers over his neck. A
caste feast is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>also exacted, and the couple are then considered
to be married. The remarriage of widows is permitted, but it is known
by the opprobrious name of <i>Kukar-gauna</i> or
&lsquo;dog-marriage,&rsquo; signifying that it is held to be little or
no better than a simple illicit connection. Divorce is also somewhat
common in the caste, notwithstanding that the person who occupies the
position of co-respondent must repay to the husband the expenses
incurred by him on the marriage ceremony. Some women are known to have
had ten or twelve husbands.</p>
<p>The J&#257;dams are proprietors, tenants and labourers, and are
reckoned to be efficient cultivators; they plough with their own hands
and allow their women to work in the fields. They will also eat food
cooked with water in the field, which is against the practice of the
higher castes. They eat flesh, including that of the wild pig, and
fish, but abstain from liquor, and will take food cooked with water
only from Jijhotia or San&#257;dhya Br&#257;hmans who are their family
priests. A Br&#257;hman will take water from the hands of a J&#257;dam
in a metal, but not in an earthen, vessel. Boys are invested with the
sacred thread at the time of their wedding, a common practice among the
higher agricultural castes, and one pointing to the hypothesis
suggested in the article on Gurao that the investiture with the sacred
thread was in its origin a rite of puberty. The women wear a peculiar
dress know as <i>sawang</i>, consisting of a small skirt of about six
feet of cloth and a long body-cloth wrapped round the waist and over
the shoulders. They also have larger spangles on the forehead than
other women. The women of the caste are emancipated to an unusual
degree, and it is stated that they commonly accompany their husbands to
market for shopping, to prevent them from being cheated. Dr. Hunter
describes the J&#257;dam as a brave soldier, but a bad agriculturist;
but in the Central Provinces his courage is rated less highly, and a
proverb quoted about him is: &lsquo;<i>Patta khatka, J&#257;dam
satka</i>,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The J&#257;dam trembles at the rustle of a
leaf.&rsquo;</p>

"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=

to turn other metals into gold or finding buried treasure. They are
believed to have originated from the caste of Bhadris or Jyotishis, the
astrologers of western India. The Jyotishi or Joshi astrologers are
probably an offshoot of the Br&#257;hman caste. The name J&#257;dua is
derived from <i>j&#257;du</i>, magic. The Bhadris or Jyotishis were in
former times, Mr. Knyvett writes, attached to the courts of all
important r&#257;jas in western India, where they told fortunes and
prophesied future events from their computations of the stars, often
obtaining great influence and being consulted as oracles. Readers of
<i>Quentin Durward</i> will not need to be reminded that an exactly
similar state of things obtained in Europe. And both the European and
Indian astrologers were continually searching for the
philosopher&rsquo;s stone and endeavouring by the practice of alchemy
to discover the secret of changing silver and other metals into gold.
It is easy to understand how the more dishonest members of the
community would come to make a livelihood by the pretence of being
possessed of this power. The J&#257;duas belong principally to
Bih&#257;r, and Mr. Knyvett&rsquo;s account of them is based on
inquiries in that Province. But it is probable that, like the Bhadris,
travelling parties of J&#257;duas occasionally visit the Central
Provinces. Their method of procedure is somewhat as follows. They start
out in parties of three or four and make inquiries for the whereabouts
of some likely dupe, in the shape of an ignorant and superstitious
person possessed of property. Sometimes they settle temporarily in a
village and open a small grain-shop in order to facilitate their
search. When the victim has been selected one of them proceeds to his
village in the disguise of a S&#257;dhu or anchorite, being usually
accompanied by another as his <i>chela</i> or disciple. Soon afterwards
the others come, one of them perhaps posing as a considerable
landholder, and go about inquiring if a very holy Br&#257;hman has been
seen. They go to the house of their intended dupe, who naturally asks
why they are seeking the Br&#257;hman; they reply that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>they
have come to do homage to him as he had turned their silver and brass
ornaments into gold. The dupe at once goes with them in search of the
Br&#257;hman, and is greatly impressed by seeing the landholder worship
him with profound respect and make him presents of cloth, money and
cattle. He at once falls into the trap and says that he too has a
quantity of silver which he would like to have turned into gold. The
Br&#257;hman pretends reluctance, but eventually yields to the
dupe&rsquo;s entreaties and allows himself to be led to the
latter&rsquo;s house, where with his <i>chela</i> he takes up his
quarters in an inner room, dark and with a mud floor. A variety of
tricks are now resorted to, to impress the dupe with the magic powers
of the swindlers. Sometimes he is directed to place a rupee on his
forehead and go to the door and look at the sun for five minutes, being
assured that when he returns the Br&#257;hman will have disappeared by
magic. Having looked at the sun for five minutes he can naturally see
nothing on returning to a dark room and expresses wonder at the
Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s disappearance and gradual reappearance as his eyes
get accustomed to the darkness. Or if the trick to be practised is the
production of buried treasure, a rupee may be buried in the ground and
after various incantations two rupees are produced from the same spot
by sleight of hand. Or by some trickery the victim is shown the mouth
of an earthen vessel containing silver or gold coins in a hole dug in
the ground. He is told that the treasure cannot be obtained until more
treasure has been added to it and religious rites have been performed.
Sometimes the victim is made to visit a secluded spot, where he is
informed that after repeating certain incantations Sivaji will appear
before him. A confederate, dressed in tinsel and paint, appears before
the victim posing as Sivaji, and informs him that there is treasure
buried in his house, and it is only necessary to follow the
instructions of the holy Br&#257;hman in order to obtain it. The silver
ornaments, all that can be collected, are then made over to the
Br&#257;hman, who pretends to tie them in a cloth or place them in an
earthen pot and bury them in the floor of the room. If buried treasure
is to be found the Br&#257;hman explains that it is first necessary to
bury more treasure in order to obtain it, and if the ornaments
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>are to be turned into gold they are buried for
the purpose of transmutation. During the process the victim is induced
on some pretence to leave the room or cover himself with a sheet, when
a bundle containing mud or stones is substituted for the treasure. The
Br&#257;hman calls for <i>gh&#299;</i>, oil and incense, and lights a
fire over the place where the ornaments are supposed to be buried,
bidding his victim watch over it for some hours or days until his
return. The Br&#257;hman and his disciple, with the silver concealed
about them, then leave the house, join their confederates and make
their escape. The duped villager patiently watches the fire until he
becomes tired of waiting for the Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s return, when he
digs up the earth and finds nothing in the cloth but stones and
rubbish.</p>

<h2 class="main">Jangam</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Jangam, Jangama.</b>&mdash;A Sivite order of
wandering religious mendicants. The Jangams are the priests or
<i>gurus</i> of the Sivite sect of Ling&#257;yats. They numbered 3500
persons in the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r in 1911, and frequent
the Mar&#257;tha country. The Jangam is said to be so called because he
wears a movable emblem of Siva (<i>jana gama</i>, to come and go) in
contradistinction to the Sth&#257;war or fixed emblems found in
temples. The Jangams discard many of the modern phases of Hinduism.
They reject the poems in honour of Vishnu, R&#257;ma and Krishna, such
as the Bh&#257;gavad Gita and R&#257;m&#257;yana; they also deny the
authority of Br&#257;hmans, the efficacy of pilgrimage and
self-mortification, and the restrictions of caste; while they revere
principally the Vedas and the teaching of the great Sivite reformer
Shankar Ach&#257;rya.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7195src" href=
"#xd21e7195" name="xd21e7195src">1</a> Like other religious orders, the
Jangams have now become a caste, and are divided into two groups of
celibate and married members. The Gharb&#257;ris (married members)
celebrate their weddings in the usual Mar&#257;tha fashion, except that
they perform no <i>hom</i> or fire sacrifice. They permit the
remarriage of widows. The Jangams wear ochre-coloured or
<i>bad&#257;mi</i> clothes and long necklaces of seeds called
<i>rudr&#257;ksha</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e7210src" href=
"#xd21e7210" name="xd21e7210src">2</a> beads, which resemble a nutmeg
in size, in colour and nearly in shape; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>they besmear their
forehead, arms and various other parts of the body with cowdung ashes.
They wear the <i>lingam</i> or phallic sign of Siva either about the
neck or loins in a little casket of gold, silver, copper or brass. As
the <i>lingam</i> is supposed to represent the god and to be eternal,
they are buried and not burnt after death, because the <i>lingam</i>
must be buried with them and must not be destroyed in the fire. If any
Jangam loses the <i>lingam</i> he or she must not eat or drink until it
has been replaced by the <i>guru</i> or spiritual preceptor. It must be
worshipped thrice a day, and ashes and <i>bel</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7236src" href="#xd21e7236" name="xd21e7236src">3</a> leaves are
offered to it, besides food when the owner is about to partake of this
himself. The Jangams worship no deity other than Siva or Mah&#257;deo,
and their great festival is the Shivr&#257;tri. Some of them make
pilgrimages to Pachmarhi, to the Mah&#257;deo hills. Most of them
subsist by begging and singing songs in praise of Mah&#257;deo.
Grant-Duff gives the Jangam as one of the twenty-four village servants
in a Mar&#257;tha village, perhaps as the priest of the local shrine of
Siva, or as the caste priest of the Ling&#257;yats, who are numerous in
some Districts of Bombay. He carries a wallet over the shoulder and a
conch-shell and bell in the hand. On approaching the door of a house he
rings his bell to bring out the occupant, and having received alms
proceeds on his way, blowing his conch-shell, which is supposed to be a
propitious act for the alms-giver, and to ensure his safe passage to
heaven. The wallet is meant to hold the grain given to him, and on
returning home he never empties it completely, but leaves a little
grain in it as its own share. The Jangams are strict vegetarians, and
take food only from the hands of Ling&#257;yats. They bless their food
before eating it and always finish it completely, and afterwards wash
the dish with water and drink down the water. When a child is born, the
priest is sent for and his feet are washed with water in a brass tray.
The water is then rubbed over the bodies of those present, and a few
drops sprinkled on the walls of the house as a ceremony of
purification. The priest&rsquo;s great toes are then washed in a cup of
water, and he dips the <i>lingam</i> he wears into this, and then sips
a few drops of the water, each person present <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>doing the same. This is called <i>karuna</i> or
sanctification. He then dips a new <i>lingam</i> into the holy water,
and ties it round the child&rsquo;s neck for a minute or two,
afterwards handing it to the mother to be kept till the child is old
enough to wear it. The dead are buried in a sitting posture, the
<i>lingam</i> being placed in the palm of the hand. On the third day a
clay image of Mah&#257;deo is carried to the grave, and food and
flowers are offered to it, as well as any intoxicants to which the
deceased person may have been addicted. The following notice of the
Jangams more than a century ago may be quoted from the Abb&eacute;
Dubois, though the custom described does not, so far as is known,
prevail at present, at least in the Central Provinces:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7255src" href="#xd21e7255" name="xd21e7255src">4</a>
&ldquo;The <i>gurus</i> or priests of Siva, who are known in the
Western Provinces by the name of Jangams, are for the most part
celibates. They have a custom which is peculiar to themselves, and
curious enough to be worth remarking. When a <i>guru</i> travels about
his district he lodges with some member of the sect, and the members
contend among themselves for the honour of receiving him. When he has
selected the house he wishes to stay in, the master and all the other
male inmates are obliged, out of respect for him, to leave it and go
and stay elsewhere. The holy man remains there day and night with only
the women of the house, whom he keeps to wait on him and cook for him,
without creating any scandal or exciting the jealousy of the husbands.
All the same, some scandal-mongers have remarked that the Jangams
always take care to choose a house where the women are young.&rdquo;
The Jangams are not given to austerities, and go about well clad.

<h3 class="main">1. Theories of the origin of the caste.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>J&#257;t.</b><a class="noteref" id="xd21e7353src"
href="#xd21e7353" name="xd21e7353src">1</a>&mdash;The representative
cultivating caste of the Punjab, corresponding to the Kurmi of
Hindust&#257;n, the Kunbi of the Deccan, and the K&#257;pu of
Teling&#257;na. In the Central Provinces 10,000 J&#257;ts were returned
in 1911, of whom 5000 belonged to Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d and the bulk of
the remainder to Narsinghpur, Saugor and Jubbulpore. The origin of the
J&#257;t caste has been the subject of much discussion. Sir D. Ibbetson
stated some of the theories as follows:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7356src" href="#xd21e7356" name="xd21e7356src">2</a>
&ldquo;Suffice it to say that both General Cunningham and Major Tod
agree in considering the J&#257;ts to be of Indo-Scythian stock. The
former identifies them with the Zanthii of Strabo and the Jatii of
Pliny and Ptolemy; and holds that they probably entered the Punjab from
their home on the Oxus very shortly after the Meds or Mands, who also
were Indo-Scythians, and who moved into the Punjab about a century
before Christ.... Major Tod classes the J&#257;ts as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>one
of the great R&#257;jp&#363;t tribes, and extends his identification
with the Getae to both races; but here General Cunningham differs,
holding the R&#257;jp&#363;ts to belong to the original Aryan stock,
and the J&#257;ts to a later wave of immigrants from the north-west,
probably of Scythian race.&rdquo; It is highly probable that the
J&#257;ts may date their settlement in the Punjab from one of the three
Scythian inroads mentioned by Mr. V. A. Smith,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7363src" href="#xd21e7363" name="xd21e7363src">3</a> but I do not
know that there is as yet considered to be adequate evidence to
identify them with any particular one.</p>
<p>The following curious passage from the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata would
appear to refer to the J&#257;ts:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7369src"
href="#xd21e7369" name="xd21e7369src">4</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;An old and excellent Br&#257;hman reviling the countries
B&#257;h&#299;ka and Madra in the dwelling of Dhritar&#257;shtra,
related facts long known, and thus described those nations. External to
the Him&#257;van, and beyond the Ganges, beyond the S&#257;rasvati and
Yamuna rivers and Kurukshetra, between five rivers, and the Sindhu as
the sixth, are situated the B&#257;h&#299;kas, devoid of ritual or
observance, and therefore to be shunned. Their figtree is named
Govardhana (<i>i.e.</i> the place of cow-killing); their market-place
is Subhadram (the place of vending liquor: at least so say the
commentators), and these give titles to the doorway of the royal
palace. A business of great importance compelled me to dwell amongst
the B&#257;h&#299;kas, and their customs are therefore well known to
me. The chief city is called Sh&#257;k&#257;la, and the river Apaga.
The people are also named Jarttikas; and their customs are shameful.
They drink spirits made from sugar and grain, and eat meat seasoned
with garlic; and live on flesh and wine: their women intoxicated appear
in public places, with no other garb than garlands and perfumes,
dancing and singing, and vociferating indecencies in tones more harsh
than those of the camel or the ass; they indulge in promiscuous
intercourse and are under no restraint. They clothe themselves in skins
and blankets, and sound the cymbal and drum and conch, and cry aloud
with hoarse voices: &lsquo;We will hasten to delight, in thick forests
and in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>pleasant places; we will feast and sport; and
gathering on the highways spring upon the travellers, and spoil and
scourge them!&rsquo; In Sh&#257;k&#257;la, a female demon (a
R&#257;kshasi) on the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight sings aloud:
&lsquo;I will feast on the flesh of kine, and quaff the inebriating
spirit attended by fair and graceful females.&rsquo; The
S&#363;dra-like B&#257;h&#299;kas have no institutes nor sacrifices;
and neither deities, manes, nor Br&#257;hmans accept their offerings.
They eat out of wooden or earthen plates, nor heed their being smeared
with wine or viands, or licked by dogs, and they use equally in its
various preparations the milk of ewes, of camels and of asses. Who that
has drunk milk in the city Yugandhara can hope to enter Svarga?
B&#257;hi and H&#299;ka were the names of two fiends in the
Vip&#257;sha river; the B&#257;h&#299;kas are their descendants and not
of the creation of Brahma. Some say the Arattas are the name of the
people and B&#257;h&#299;ka of the waters. The Vedas are not known
there, nor oblation, nor sacrifice, and the gods will not partake of
their food. The Prasthalas (perhaps borderers), Madras, Gandharas,
Arattas, Khashas, Vasas, Atisindhus (or those beyond the Indus),
Sauv&#299;ras, are all equally infamous. There one who is by birth a
Br&#257;hman, becomes a Kshatriya, or a Vaishya, or a S&#363;dra, or a
Barber, and having been a barber becomes a Br&#257;hman again. A
virtuous woman was once violated by Aratta ruffians, and she cursed the
race, and their women have ever since been unchaste. On this account
their heirs are their sisters&rsquo; children, not their own. All
countries have their laws and gods: the Yavanas are wise, and
preeminently brave; the Mlechchas observe their own ritual, but the
Madrakas are worthless. Madra is the ordure of the earth: it is the
region of inebriety, unchastity, robbery, and murder: fie on the
Panchanada people! fie on the Aratta race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the above account the country referred to is clearly the Punjab,
from the mention of the five rivers and the Indus. The people are
called B&#257;h&#299;ka or Jarttika, and would therefore seem to be the
J&#257;ts. And the account would appear to refer to a period when they
were newly settled in the Punjab and had not come under Hindu
influence. But at the same time the Aryans or Hindus had passed through
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>the Punjab and were settled in Hindust&#257;n.
And it would therefore seem to be a necessary inference that the
J&#257;ts were comparatively late immigrants, and were one of the
tribes who invaded India between the second century <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> and the fifth century <span class="sc">A.D.</span> as
suggested above.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Sir D. Ibbetson&rsquo;s description of the
caste.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sir D. Ibbetson held that the J&#257;ts and
R&#257;jp&#363;ts must be, to some extent at least, of the same blood.
Though the J&#257;ts are represented in the Central Provinces only by a
small body of immigrants it will be permissible to quote the following
passages from his admirable and classical account of the
caste:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7400src" href="#xd21e7400" name=
"xd21e7400src">5</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that the original R&#257;jp&#363;t and the original
J&#257;t entered India at different periods in its history, though to
my mind the term R&#257;jp&#363;t is an occupational rather than an
ethnological expression. But if they do originally represent two
separate waves of immigration, it is at least exceedingly probable,
both from their almost identical physique and facial character and from
the close communion which has always existed between them, that they
belong to one and the same ethnic stock; while, whether this be so or
not, it is almost certain that they have been for many centuries and
still are so intermingled and so blended into one people that it is
practically impossible to distinguish them as separate wholes. It is
indeed more than probable that the process of fusion has not ended
here, and that the people who thus in the main resulted from the
blending of the J&#257;t and the R&#257;jp&#363;t, if these two were
ever distinct, is by no means free from foreign elements....</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">3. Are the J&#257;ts and R&#257;jp&#363;ts
distinct?</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;But whether J&#257;ts and R&#257;jp&#363;ts
were or were not originally distinct, and whatever aboriginal elements
may have been affiliated to their society, I think that the two now
form a common stock, the distinction between J&#257;t and
R&#257;jp&#363;t being social rather than ethnic. I believe that those
families of that common stock whom the tide of fortune has raised to
political importance have become R&#257;jp&#363;ts almost by mere
virtue of their rise; and that their descendants have retained the
title and its privileges on the condition, strictly enforced, of
observing the rules by which the higher are distinguished from the
lower castes in the Hindu scale of precedence; of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>preserving their purity of blood by refusing to
marry with families of inferior social rank, of rigidly abstaining from
widow-marriage, and of refraining from degrading occupations. Those who
transgressed these rules have fallen from their high position and
ceased to be R&#257;jp&#363;ts; while such families as, attaining a
dominant position in their territory, began to affect social
exclusiveness and to observe the rules, have become not only R&#257;jas
but also R&#257;jp&#363;ts or sons of R&#257;jas. For the last seven
centuries at least the process of elevation has been almost at a
standstill. Under the Delhi Emperors king-making was practically
impossible. Under the Sikhs the R&#257;jp&#363;t was overshadowed by
the J&#257;t, who resented his assumption of superiority and his
refusal to join him on equal terms in the ranks of the Kh&#257;lsa,
deliberately persecuted him wherever and whenever he had the power, and
preferred his title of J&#257;t Sikh to that of the proudest
R&#257;jp&#363;t. On the frontier the dominance of Path&#257;ns and
Biloches and the general prevalence of Muhammadan feelings and ideas
placed recent Indian origin at a discount, and led the leading families
who belonged to neither of these two races to claim connection not with
the Kshatriyas of the Sanskrit classics but with the Mughal conquerors
of India or the Qureshi cousins of the Prophet; in so much that even
admittedly R&#257;jp&#363;t tribes of famous ancestry, such as the
Khokha, have begun to follow the example. But in the hills, where
R&#257;jp&#363;t dynasties, with genealogies perhaps more ancient and
unbroken than can be shown by any other royal families in the world,
retained their independence till yesterday, and where many of them
still enjoy as great social authority as ever, the twin processes of
degradation from and elevation to R&#257;jp&#363;t rank are still to be
seen in operation. The R&#257;ja is there the fountain not only of
honour but also of caste, which is the same thing in India....</p>

<h3 class="main">4. The position of the J&#257;t in the Punjab.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The J&#257;t is in every respect the most
important of the Punjab peoples. In point of numbers he surpasses the
R&#257;jp&#363;t, who comes next to him, in the proportion of nearly
three to one; while the two together constitute twenty-seven per cent
of the whole population of the Province. Politically he ruled the
Punjab till the Kh&#257;lsa yielded to our arms. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>Ethnologically he is the peculiar and most
prominent product of the plain of the five rivers. And from an
economical and administrative point of view he is the husbandman, the
peasant, the revenue-payer <i>par excellence</i> of the Province. His
manners do not bear the impress of generations of wild freedom which
marks the races of our frontier mountains. But he is more honest, more
industrious, more sturdy, and no less manly than they. Sturdy
independence indeed and patient, vigorous labour are his strongest
characteristics. The J&#257;t is of all Punjab races the most impatient
of tribal or communal control, and the one which asserts the freedom of
the individual most strongly. In tracts where, as in Rohtak, the
J&#257;t tribes have the field to themselves, and are compelled, in
default of rival castes as enemies, to fall back upon each other for
somebody to quarrel with, the tribal ties are strong. But as a rule a
J&#257;t is a man who does what seems right in his own eyes and
sometimes what seems wrong also, and will not be said nay by any man. I
do not mean, however, that he is turbulent; as a rule he is very far
from being so. He is independent and he is self-willed; but he is
reasonable, peaceably inclined if left alone, and not difficult to
manage. He is usually content to cultivate his fields and pay his
revenue in peace and quietness if people will let him do so; though
when he does go wrong he takes to anything from gambling to murder,
with perhaps a preference for stealing other people&rsquo;s wives and
cattle. As usual the proverbial wisdom of the villages describes him
very fairly though perhaps somewhat too severely: &lsquo;The soil,
fodder, clothes, hemp, grass-fibre, and silk, these six are best
beaten; and the seventh is the J&#257;t.&rsquo; &lsquo;A J&#257;t, a
Bh&#257;t, a caterpillar, and a widow woman; these four are best
hungry. If they eat their fill they do harm.&rsquo; &lsquo;The
J&#257;t, like a wound, is better when bound.&rsquo; In agriculture the
J&#257;t is pre-eminent. The market-gardening castes, the Ar&#257;in,
the M&#257;li, the Saini are perhaps more skilful cultivators on a
small scale; but they cannot rival the J&#257;t as landowners and
yeoman cultivators. The J&#257;t calls himself zam&#299;nd&#257;r or
&lsquo;husbandman&rsquo; as often as J&#257;t, and his women and
children alike work with him in the fields: &lsquo;The J&#257;t&rsquo;s
baby has a plough-handle for a plaything.&rsquo; &lsquo;The J&#257;t
stood on his corn heap and said to the king&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>elephant-drivers, Will you sell those little
donkeys?&rsquo; Socially the J&#257;t occupies a position which is
shared by the Ror, the G&#363;jar, and the Ah&#299;r, all four eating
and smoking together. He is, of course, far below the R&#257;jp&#363;t,
from the simple fact that he practises widow-marriage. The J&#257;t
father is made to say in the rhyming proverbs of the countryside,
&lsquo;Come, my daughter, and be married; if this husband dies there
are plenty more.&rsquo; But among the widow-marrying castes he stands
first. The Bania with his sacred thread, his strict Hinduism, and his
twice-born standing, looks down on the J&#257;t as a S&#363;dra. But
the J&#257;t looks down upon the Bania as a cowardly, spiritless
money-grubber, and society in general agrees with the J&#257;t. The
Khatri, who is far superior to the Bania in manliness and vigour,
probably takes precedence of the J&#257;t. But among the races or
tribes of purely Hindu origin, I think that the J&#257;t stands next
after the Br&#257;hman, the R&#257;jp&#363;t, and the
Khatri.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Social status of the J&#257;ts.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The above account clearly indicates the social
position of the J&#257;t. His is the highest caste except the
aristocracy consisting of the Br&#257;hmans and R&#257;jp&#363;ts, the
Khatris who are derived from the R&#257;jp&#363;ts, and the Banias who
are recognised as ranking not much below the R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The
derivation of some of the R&#257;jp&#363;t clans from the J&#257;ts
seems highly probable, and is confirmed by other instances of
aristocratic selection in such castes as the Mar&#257;thas and Kunbis,
the R&#257;j-Gonds and Gonds, and so on. If, however, the
R&#257;jp&#363;ts are a J&#257;t aristocracy, it is clear that the
J&#257;ts were not the S&#363;dras, who are described as wholly debased
and impure in the Hindu classics; and the present application of the
term S&#363;dra to them is a misnomer arising from modern errors in
classification by the Hindus themselves. The J&#257;ts, if Sir D.
Ibbetson&rsquo;s account be accepted, must have been the main body of
the invading host, whether Aryan or Scythian, of whom the
R&#257;jp&#363;ts were the leaders. They settled on the land and formed
village communities, and the status of the J&#257;t at present appears
to be that of a member of the village community and part-holder of its
land. A slightly undue importance may perhaps have been given in the
above passage to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232"
name="pb232">232</a>]</span>practice of widow-marriage as determining
the position of a great caste like the J&#257;ts. Some
R&#257;jp&#363;ts, K&#257;yasths and Banias permit widow-marriage, and
considerable sections of all these castes, and Br&#257;hmans also,
permit the practice of keeping widows, which, though not called a
marriage, does not differ very widely from it. The J&#257;t probably
finds his women too valuable as assistants in cultivation to make a
pretence at the abolition of widow-marriage in order to improve his
social status as some other castes do. The J&#257;t, of course, ranks
as what is commonly called a pure caste, in that Br&#257;hmans take
water to drink from him. But his status does not depend on this,
because Br&#257;hmans take water from such menials as barbers,
Kah&#257;rs or bearers, B&#257;ris or household servants, and so on,
who rank far below the J&#257;t, and also from the M&#257;lis and other
gardening castes who are appreciably below him. The J&#257;t is equal
to the G&#363;jar and Ah&#299;r so far as social purity is concerned,
but still above them, because they are graziers and vagrants, while he
is a settled cultivator. It is from this fact that his status is
perhaps mainly derived; and his leading characteristics, his
independence, self-sufficiency, doggedness, and industry, are those
generally recognised as typical of the peasant proprietor. But the
J&#257;t, in the Punjab at any rate, has also a higher status than the
principal cultivating castes of other provinces, the Kurmi and the
Kunbi. And this may perhaps be explained by his purer foreign descent,
and also by the fact that both as J&#257;t and as Sikh his caste has
been a military and dominant one in history and has furnished princes
and heads of states.</p>

<h3 class="main">6. Br&#257;hmanical legend of origin.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The J&#257;ts themselves relate the following
Br&#257;hmanical legend of their origin. On one occasion when
Him&#257;chal or Daksha R&#257;ja, the father-in-law of Mah&#257;deo,
was performing a great sacrifice, he invited all the gods to be present
except his son-in-law Mah&#257;deo (Siva). The latter&rsquo;s wife
P&#257;rvati was, however, very anxious to go, so she asked
Mah&#257;deo to let her attend, even though she had not been invited.
Mah&#257;deo was unwilling to do this, but finally consented. But
Daksha treated P&#257;rvati with great want of respect at the
sacrifice, so she came home and told Mah&#257;deo about him. When
Mah&#257;deo heard this he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233"
href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>filled with wrath, and
untying his matted hair (<i>jata</i>) dashed it on the ground, when two
powerful beings arose from it. He sent them to destroy Daksha&rsquo;s
sacrifice and they went and destroyed it, and from these were descended
the race of the J&#257;ts, and they take their name from the matted
locks (<i>jata</i>) of the lord Mah&#257;deo. Another saying of the
caste is that &ldquo;The ancestor of the R&#257;jp&#363;ts was
Kashyap<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7446src" href="#xd21e7446" name=
"xd21e7446src">6</a> and of the J&#257;ts Siva. In the beginning these
were the only two races of India.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No detailed description of the J&#257;ts need be
attempted here, but some information which has been obtained on their
customs in this Province may be recorded. They entered the
Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d District, Sir C. Elliot states,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7454src" href="#xd21e7454" name="xd21e7454src">7</a> in the
eighteenth century, and came originally from Bharatpur (Bhurtpur), but
halted in M&#257;rw&#257;r on the way. &ldquo;They are the best
cultivators in the District after the Pardeshi Kurmis, and though they
confine themselves to ordinary crops they are very laborious, and the
tilth of their fields is pleasant to look on.&rdquo; For the purposes
of marriage the caste is divided into exogamous sections in the usual
manner. The bulk of the section-names cannot be explained, being
probably corrupted forms of the names of villages, but it is noticeable
that several pairs of them are considered to be related so that their
members cannot intermarry. Thus no marriages can take place between the
Golia and Gwalwa, the Choyala and S&#257;rana, the Bhukar and
Bh&#257;ri, and the Lathial and L&#257;lar sections, as each pair is
considered to be descended from a common ancestor.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A man may not take a wife either from his own section
or that of his mother or his grandmother, nor from those of the
husbands of his father&rsquo;s sisters. For a J&#257;t wedding a square
enclosure is marked out with pegs, and a thread is wound seven times
round the pegs touching the ground, and covered over with rice or wheat
so that it may not be burnt. The enclosure is known as Chaonri, and
inside it the <i>hom</i> or fire sacrifice is performed with butter,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>barley, sesamum, sugar and saffron placed on the
top of a heap of wheat-flour. After the sacrifice the bride and
bridegroom walk seven times round the Chaonri with their right hands
inwards. After this tufts of cotton are thrown over the bodies of the
bridegroom and bride and they have to pick it off each other, the one
who finishes first being considered the winner. This is apparently a
symbolical imitation of the agricultural operation of cotton-picking.
The remarriage of widows is permitted, the ceremony being usually
performed on a Saturday. A bachelor who is to marry a widow must first
walk seven times round a p&#299;pal tree. Contrary to the usual custom,
a widow is forbidden to espouse her deceased husband&rsquo;s younger
brother or any of his relations within three degrees of
consanguinity.</p>

under seven whose bodies are buried. After the death of a married man
his widow walks round his body seven times with her left hand inwards,
or in the reverse direction to the perambulation of the Chaonri at
marriage. This ceremony is therefore, as it were, a sort of undoing of
the marriage. The women wear lac or ivory bangles, and the widow breaks
a few of these when the corpse of her husband is lifted up to be
carried outside the house. She breaks the remaining ones on the twelfth
day after the death and throws them on the <i>ch&#363;lha</i> or

<h3 class="main">10. The Paida ceremony.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An important occasion for display among the J&#257;ts
is known as the Paida ceremony. This is sometimes performed by wealthy
families when the head of the household or his wife dies or a daughter
is married. They get a long pole of teakwood and plant it in the ground
so that it stands some forty feet high. Before being raised the pole is
worshipped with offerings of milk; a cart-wheel is tied to the upper
end and it is then pulled erect with ropes, and if any difficulty is
experienced the celebrant believes himself to be in fault and gives
away some cows in charity. On the axle of the cart-wheel is secured a
brass pot called <i>kaseri,</i> containing wheat and money, with a
cloth tied over the mouth. The pole is left standing for three days,
and during this time the celebrant feasts the Bh&#257;ts or
genealogists of the caste and all the caste-fellows from his own and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>the surrounding villages. If the occasion of the
ceremony be a death, male and female calves are taken and their
marriage is performed; oil and turmeric are rubbed on their bodies, and
they are led seven times round the high pole. The heifer is then given
to a Br&#257;hman, and the male, being first branded on one flank with
a figure of a trident and on the other with a representation of the sun
and moon, is set at liberty for life, and no Hindu will injure it. This
last practice is, however, falling into desuetude, owing to the injury
which such animals inflict on the crops. A J&#257;t who performs the
Paida ceremony obtains great consideration in the community, and his
opinion is given weight in caste disputes. A similar liberality is
observed in other ways by wealthy men; thus one rich proprietor in
Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d, whose son was to be married, gave a feast to all
the residents of every village through which the wedding procession
passed on its way to the bride&rsquo;s house. Another presented each of
his wedding guests with new cloth to the value of ten or twelve rupees,
and as in the case of a prominent family the number of guests may be a
thousand or more, the cost of such liberality can be easily realised.
Similarly Colonel Tod states that on the occasion of their weddings the
J&#257;ts of Bikaner even blocked up the highways to obtain visitors,
whose numbers formed the measure of the liberality and munificence of
the donor of the f&ecirc;te. Indeed, the desire for the social
distinction which accrues to generous hosts on such occasions has
proved to be the undoing of many a once notable family.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If a woman is barren, she is taken to the meeting of
the boundaries of three villages and bathed there. On the birth of a
boy a brass dish is hammered to announce the event, but on that of a
girl only a winnowing-fan. The navel-string is buried in the lying-in
room. When the newborn child is a few days old, it is taken out of
doors and made to bow to the sun. When a man proposes to adopt a son
the caste-fellows are invited, and in their presence the boy is seated
in his lap, while music is played and songs are sung by the women. Each
of the guests then comes up and presents the boy with a cocoanut, while
sugar is distributed and a feast is afterwards given. <span class=

<h3 class="main">12. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The favourite deity of the caste is Siva or
Mah&#257;deo, whom they consider to be their ultimate ancestor. On the
festival of Shivr&#257;tri (Siva&rsquo;s night) they observe a total
fast, and pass the whole day and night singing songs in honour of the
god, while offerings of <i>bel</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e7502src"
href="#xd21e7502" name="xd21e7502src">8</a> leaves, flowers, rice and
sandalwood are made on the following morning. In Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d
the caste have two minor deities, R&#257;mj&#299; Deo and Bairam Deo,
who are presumably the spirits of defunct warriors. These are
worshipped on the eleventh day of every month, and many J&#257;ts wear
an impression of their images on a piece of gold or silver round the
neck. On the Dasahra festival the caste worship their swords and horses
in memory of their soldier ancestors, and they revere their implements
of husbandry on the Akshaya Tritiya of Bais&#257;kh (June), the
commencement of the agricultural year, while each cultivator does the
same on the days that he completes the sowing of his rain crops and
winter crops.</p>

<h3 class="main">13. Social customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste employ Br&#257;hmans for the performance of
their ceremonies, and also as their <i>gurus</i> or spiritual
preceptors. They eat flesh and drink liquor in the Central Provinces,
but in Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d they do not consume either birds or fish;
and when they eat mutton or the flesh of the wild pig, they do this
only outside the house, in order not to offend their women, who will
not eat flesh. In Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d the J&#257;ts, like other
immigrants from M&#257;rw&#257;r, commonly wear their hair long and
keep the face unshaven, and this gives them rather a wild and
<i>farouche</i> appearance among the neatly shorn Hindus of the
Nerbudda Valley.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7517src" href="#xd21e7517"
name="xd21e7517src">9</a> They are of light complexion, the difference
in shade between the J&#257;ts and ordinary residents in the locality
being apparent to the casual observer. Their women are fond of the
hollow anklets known as <i>bora</i>, which contain small balls or
pebbles, and tinkle as they walk. Girls are tattooed before marriage,
and while the operation is being carried out the women of the caste
collect and sing songs to divert the sufferer&rsquo;s attention from
the pain. The men have <i>pagris</i> or turbans made of many little
strings of twisted cloth, which come down over the ears. If a man kills
a cow or a squirrel, he must stay outside the village for five weeks
and nobody looks upon his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>face. After this he should go and
bathe in the Ganges, but if he is too poor the Nerbudda may be
substituted for it with the permission of the caste committee. The
penalty for killing a cat is almost as severe, but to slay a dog
involves no sin. If a man who has committed a murder escapes conviction
but his guilt is known to the caste, it is absolutely incumbent on him
to go and bathe in the Ganges and be purified there, having his head
and face shaved. After this he may be readmitted to caste intercourse.
The caste observe some curious rules or taboos: they never drink the
milk of a black cow; their women do not have their noses bored for
nose-rings, but if a woman loses several children she will have the
nose bored of the next one which is born; women never wear glass
bangles, but have them made of ivory or lac and clay; they never wear
the <i>b&#257;zuband</i> or armlet with bars crossed on hinges which
can be pulled in or out, but instead of it the <i>kara</i> or rigid
bangle; and the caste never keep a basil plant in the house for
worship, though they may revere it outside the house. As the basil is
the emblem of Vishnu, and the J&#257;ts consider themselves to be
descended from Siva, they would naturally not be inclined to pay any
special respect to the plant.</p>

<p class="first">The J&#257;ts are good cultivators, and at the thirty
years&rsquo; settlement (1865) several members of the caste held
considerable estates; but a number of these have now been lost, owing
probably to extravagance of living. In Saugor the J&#257;ts are
commonly employed as masons or navvies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

small caste in the Bastar State who appear to be a mixture of Gonds and
the lower Telugu castes, the name meaning &lsquo;The jungly
Telugus.&rsquo; Those living in the open country are called M&#257;ndar
Telengas. In the census of 1901 these Telengas were wrongly classified
under the Balji or Balija caste. They numbered about 5000 persons. The
caste have three divisions according to their comparative purity of
descent, which are named Pur&#257;it, Sur&#257;it and Pohni. The son of
a Pur&#257;it by a woman of different caste will be a Sur&#257;it, and
the son of a Sur&#257;it by such a woman will be a Pohni. Such
alliances are now, however, infrequent, and most of the Telengas in
Bastar belong to the Pur&#257;it or legitimate group. A Pohni will take
cooked food from the two higher groups and a Sur&#257;it from a
Pur&#257;it. The last will take water from the two lower groups, but
not food.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Exogamous divisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For the purposes of marriage the caste is divided into
the usual exogamous septs, and these are further arranged in two
groups. The first group contains the following septs: Kudmulw&#257;du,
from <i>kudmul</i>, a preparation of rice; Kolmulw&#257;du, from
<i>kolmul</i>, a treasure-pit; Lingaw&#257;du, from the <i>linga</i>
emblem; and N&#257;gulw&#257;du, a ploughman. The second group contains
the following septs: Kodamajjiw&#257;du, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>a hunter and trapper
of animals; Wargaiw&#257;du, one who makes ropes from wood-fibre;
Paspulw&#257;du, one who prepares turmeric; Pankiw&#257;du, one who
distributes cooked food; Bhand&#257;r&#299;w&#257;du, a rich man; and
one or two others. The rule is that no man or woman of a sept belonging
to the first group should marry in any other sept of that group, but
always from some sept of the other. This, therefore, appears to be a
relic of the classificatory system of marriage, which obtains among the
Australian aborigines. The rule is now, however, sometimes violated.
The caste say that their ancestors came from Warangal with the ruling
family of Bastar.</p>

Halbas into the community. If a man of any of these castes has a child
by a Telenga woman, this child will be considered to belong to the same
group of the Jh&#257;di Telengas as its mother. If a man of lower
caste, such as R&#257;wat, Dh&#257;kar, Jangam, Kumh&#257;r or
Kal&#257;r has such a child it will be admitted into the next lower
group than that to which the mother belonged. Thus the child of a
Pur&#257;it woman by one of these castes will become a Sur&#257;it. A
Telenga woman having a child by a Gond, Sun&#257;r, Loh&#257;r or Mehra
man is put out of caste.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A girl cannot be properly married unless the ceremony
is performed before she arrives at puberty. After this she can only be
married by an abridged rite, which consists of rubbing her with oil and
turmeric, investing her with glass bangles and a new cloth, and giving
a feast to the caste. In such a case the bridegroom first goes through
a sham marriage with the branch of a mahua tree. The boy&rsquo;s father
looks out for a girl, and the most suitable match is considered to be
his sister&rsquo;s daughter. Before giving away his daughter he must
ask his wife&rsquo;s brother and his own sister whether they want her
for one of their sons. When setting out to make a proposal they take
the omens from a bird called Usi. The best omen is to hear this
bird&rsquo;s call on both sides of them as they go into the jungle.
When asking for the girl the envoys say to her father, &lsquo;You have
got rice and pulse; give them to us for our friend&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;
The wedding should be held on a Monday or Thursday, and the bridegroom
should arrive at the bride&rsquo;s village on a Sunday, Tuesday,
Wednesday <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>or Friday. The sacred post in the centre of the
marriage-shed must be of the mahua<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7627src"
href="#xd21e7627" name="xd21e7627src">2</a> tree, which is no doubt
held sacred by these people, as by the Gonds, because spirituous liquor
is made from its fruit. A widow must mourn her husband for a month, and
can then marry again. But she may not marry her late husband&rsquo;s
brother, nor his first cousin, nor any member of her father&rsquo;s
sept. Divorce is allowed, but no man will divorce his wife unless she
leaves him of her own accord or is known to be intriguing with a man of
lower caste.</p>

<h3 class="main">5. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Each sept has a deity of its own who is usually some
local god symbolised by a wooden post or a stone. Instances of these
are Kondr&#257;j of Santoshpur represented by a wooden pillar carved
into circular form at the top; Chikat R&#257;j of Bij&#257;pur by two
bamboos six feet in length leaning against a wall; Kaunam R&#257;j of
Gongla by a stone image, and at fairs by a bamboo with peacock&rsquo;s
feathers tied at the top. They offer incense, rice and a fowl to their
ancestors in their own houses in Chait (March) at the new year, and at
the festival of the new rice in Bh&#257;don (August). At the sowing
festival they go out hunting, and those who return empty-handed think
they will have ill-luck. Each tenant also worships the earth-goddess,
whose image is then decorated with flowers and vermilion. He brings a
goat, and rice is placed before it at her shrine. If the animal eats
the sacrifice is held to be accepted, but if not it is returned to the
owner, and it is thought that some misfortune will befall him. The
heads of all the goats offered are taken by the priest and the bodies
returned to the worshippers to be consumed at a feast. Each village has
also its tutelary god, having a hut to himself. Inside this a post of
mahua wood is fixed in the ground and roughly squared, and a peg is
driven into it at the top. The god is represented by another bamboo peg
about two inches long, which is first worshipped in front of the post
and then suspended from it in a receptacle. In each village the
smallpox goddess is also present in the form of a stone, either with or
without a hut over it. A Jangam or devotee of the Ling&#257;yat sect is
usually the caste priest, and at a funeral he follows the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>corpse ringing his bell. If a man is put out of
caste through getting maggots in a wound or being beaten by a shoe, he
must be purified by the Jangam. The latter rubs some ashes on his own
body and places them in the offender&rsquo;s mouth, and gives him to
drink some water from his own <i>lota</i> in place of water from a
sacred river. For this the offender pays a fee of five rupees and a
calf to the Jangam and must also give a feast to the caste. The dead
are either buried or burnt, the head being placed to the east. The
eldest son has his head and face shaved on the death of the father of
the family, and the youngest on that of the mother.</p>

name unsuitable and change it, repeating those of deceased relatives.
When the child stops crying at the mention of a particular name, they
consider that the relative mentioned has been born again in the child

<h3 class="main">7. Magical devices</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When a man wishes to destroy an enemy he makes an
image of him with earth and offers a pig and goat to the family god,
praying for the enemy&rsquo;s destruction. Then the operator takes a
frog or a tree-lizard which has been kept ready and breaks all its
limbs, thinking that the limbs of his enemy will similarly be broken
and that the man will die. Or he takes some grains of <i>kossa</i>, a
small millet, and proceeds to a <i>s&#257;j</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7656src" href="#xd21e7656" name="xd21e7656src">3</a> or mahua
tree. A pigeon is offered to the tree and to the family god, and both
are asked to destroy the foe. The man then ascends the tree, and
muttering incantations throws the grains in the direction of his enemy
thinking that they will enter his body and destroy him. To counteract
these devices a man who thinks himself bewitched calls in the aid of a
wizard, who sucks out of his body the grains or other evil things which
have been caused to enter it as shown above. Occasionally a man will
promise a human sacrifice to his god. For this he must get <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>some
hair or a piece of cloth belonging to somebody else and wash it in
water in the name of the god, who may then kill the owner of the hair
or cloth and thus obtain the sacrifice. Or the sacrificer may pick a
quarrel and assault the other person so as to draw blood from him. He
picks up a drop or two of the blood and offers it to the deity with the
same end in view.</p>

<h3 class="main">1. The Yoga philosophy.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Jogi, Yogi.</b>&mdash;The well-known order of
religious mendicants and devotees of Siva. The Jogi or Yogi, properly
so called, is a follower of the Yoga system of philosophy founded by
P&#257;tanjali, the main characteristics of which are a belief in the
power of man over nature by means of austerities and the occult
influences of the will. The idea is that one who has obtained complete
control over himself, and entirely subdued all fleshly desires,
acquires such potency of mind and will that he can influence the forces
of nature at his pleasure. The Yoga philosophy has indeed so much
sub-stratum of truth that a man who has complete control of himself has
the strongest will, and hence the most power to influence others, and
an exaggerated idea of this power is no doubt fostered by the display
of mesmeric control and similar phenomena. The fact that the influence
which can be exerted over other human beings through their minds in no
way extends to the physical phenomena of inanimate nature is obvious to
us, but was by no means so to the uneducated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>Hindus, who have no clear conceptions of the
terms mental and physical, animate and inanimate, nor of the ideas
connoted by them. To them all nature was animate, and all its phenomena
the results of the actions of sentient beings, and hence it was not
difficult for them to suppose that men could influence the proceedings
of such beings. And it is a matter of common knowledge that savage
peoples believe their magicians to be capable of producing rain and
fine weather, and even of controlling the course of the sun.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7773src" href="#xd21e7773" name="xd21e7773src">1</a>
The Hindu sacred books indeed contain numerous instances of ascetics
who by their austerities acquired such powers as to compel the highest
gods themselves to obedience.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Abstraction of the senses or autohypnotism.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The term Yoga is held to mean unity or communion with
God, and the Yogi by virtue of his painful discipline and mental and
physical exercises considered himself divine. &ldquo;The adept acquires
the knowledge of everything past and future, remote or hidden; he
divines the thoughts of others, gains the strength of an elephant, the
courage of a lion, and the swiftness of the wind; flies into the air,
floats in the water, and dives into the earth, contemplates all worlds
at one glance and performs many strange things.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7789src" href="#xd21e7789" name=
"xd21e7789src">2</a></p>
<p>The following excellent instance of the pretensions of the Yogis is
given by Professor Oman:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7797src" href=
"#xd21e7797" name="xd21e7797src">3</a> &ldquo;Wolff went also with Mr.
Wilson to see one of the celebrated Yogis who was lying in the sun in
the street, the nails of whose hands were grown into his cheeks and a
bird&rsquo;s nest upon his head. Wolff asked him, &lsquo;How can one
obtain the knowledge of God?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;Do not ask me
questions; you may look at me, for I am God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certainly not easy at the present day,&rdquo; Professor
Oman states,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7805src" href="#xd21e7805"
name="xd21e7805src">4</a> &ldquo;for the western mind to enter into the
spirit of the so-called Yoga philosophy; but the student of religious
opinions is aware that in the early centuries of our era the Gnostics,
Manich&aelig;ans and Neo-Platonists derived their peculiar tenets and
practices from the <i>Yoga-vidya</i> of India, and that at a later date
the <i>Sufi</i> philosophy of Persia drew its most remarkable ideas
from the same source.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7816src" href=
"#xd21e7816" name="xd21e7816src">5</a> The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>great historian of the Roman Empire refers to
the subject in the following passage: &ldquo;The Fak&#299;rs of India
and the monks of the Oriental Church, were alike persuaded that in
total abstraction of the faculties of the mind and body, the pure
spirit may ascend to the enjoyment and vision of the Deity. The opinion
and practice of the monasteries of Mount Athos will be best represented
in the words of an abbot, who flourished in the eleventh century:
&lsquo;When thou art alone in thy cell,&rsquo; says the ascetic
teacher, &lsquo;Shut thy door, and seat thyself in a corner, raise thy
mind above all things vain and transitory, recline thy beard and chin
on thy breast, turn thine eyes and thy thoughts towards the middle of
the belly, the region of the navel, and search the place of the heart,
the seat of the soul. At first all will be dark and comfortless; but if
you persevere day and night, you will feel an ineffable joy; and no
sooner has the soul discovered the place of the heart, than it is
involved in a mystic and ethereal light.&rsquo; This light, the
production of a distempered fancy, the creature of an empty stomach and
an empty brain, was adored by the Quietists as the pure and perfect
essence of God Himself.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7825src"
href="#xd21e7825" name="xd21e7825src">6</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Without entering into unnecessary details, many of which are
simply disgusting, I shall quote, as samples, a few of the rules of
practice required to be followed by the would-be Yogi in order to
induce a state of Sam&#257;dhi&mdash;hypnotism or trance&mdash;which is
the condition or state in which the Yogi is to enjoy the promised
privileges of Yoga. The extracts are from a treatise on the Yoga
philosophy by Assistant Surgeon Nobin Chander P&#257;l.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7833src" href="#xd21e7833" name=
"xd21e7833src">7</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Place the left foot upon the right thigh, and the right foot
upon the left thigh; hold with the right hand the right great toe and
with the left hand the left great toe (the hands coming from behind the
back and crossing each other); rest the chin on the interclavicular
space, and fix the sight on the tip of the nose.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Inspire through the left nostril, fill the stomach with the
inspired air by the act of deglutition, suspend the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>breath, and expire through the right nostril.
Next inspire through the right nostril, swallow the inspired air,
suspend the breath, and finally expire through the left nostril.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Be seated in a tranquil posture, and fix your sight on the
tip of the nose for the space of ten minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close the ears with the middle fingers, incline the head a
little to the right side and listen with each ear attentively to the
sound produced by the other ear, for the space of ten minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pronounce inaudibly twelve thousand times the mystic syllable
Om, and meditate upon it daily after deep inspirations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a few forcible inspirations swallow the tongue, and
thereby suspend the breath and deglutate the saliva for two hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the sounds within the right ear abstractedly for
two hours, with the left ear.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Repeat the mystic syllable Om 20,736,000 times in silence and
meditate upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspend the respiratory movements for the period of twelve
days, and you will be in a state of Sam&#257;dhi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another account of a similar procedure is given by
Buchanan:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7868src" href="#xd21e7868" name=
"xd21e7868src">8</a> &ldquo;Those who pretend to be eminent saints
perform the ceremony called Yoga, described in the Tantras. In the
accomplishment of this, by shutting what are called the nine passages
(<i>dw&#257;ra</i>, lit. doors) of the body, the votary is supposed to
distribute the breath into the different parts of the body, and thus to
obtain the beatific vision of various gods. It is only persons who
abstain from the indulgence of concupiscence that can pretend to
perform this ceremony, which during the whole time that the breath can
be held in the proper place excites an ecstasy equal to whatever woman
can bestow on man.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Breathing through either nostril.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is clear that the effect of some of the above
practices is designed to produce a state of mind resembling the
hypnotic trance. The Yogis attach much importance to the effect of
breathing through one or the other nostril, and this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>is
also the case with Hindus generally, as various rules concerning it are
prescribed for the daily prayers of Br&#257;hmans. To have both
nostrils free and be breathing through them at the same time is not
good, and one should not begin any business in this condition. If one
is breathing only through the right nostril and the left is closed, the
condition is propitious for the following actions: To eat and drink, as
digestion will be quick; to fight; to bathe; to study and read; to ride
on a horse; to work at one&rsquo;s livelihood. A sick man should take
medicine when he is breathing through his right nostril. To be
breathing only through the left nostril is propitious for the following
undertakings: To lay the foundations of a house and to take up
residence in a new house; to put on new clothes; to sow seed; to do
service or found a village; to make any purchase. The Jogis practise
the art of breathing in this manner by stopping up their right and left
nostril alternately with cotton-wool and breathing only through the
other. If a man comes to a Br&#257;hman to ask him whether some
business or undertaking will succeed, the Br&#257;hman breathes through
his nostrils on to his hand; if the breath comes through the right
nostril the omen is favourable and the answer yes; if through the left
nostril the omen is unfavourable and the answer no.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Self-torture of the Jogis.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following account of the austerities of the Jogis
during the Mughal period is given by Bernier:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7888src" href="#xd21e7888" name="xd21e7888src">9</a> &ldquo;Among
the vast number and endless variety of Fak&#299;rs or Dervishes, and
holy men or Gentile hypocrites of the Indies, many live in a sort of
convent, governed by superiors, where vows of chastity, poverty, and
submission are made. So strange is the life led by these votaries that
I doubt whether my description of it will be credited. I allude
particularly to the people called &lsquo;Jogis,&rsquo; a name which
signifies &lsquo;United to God.&rsquo; Numbers are seen day and night,
seated or lying on ashes, entirely naked; frequently under the large
trees near <i>tal&#257;bs</i> or tanks of water, or in the galleries
round the Deuras or idol temples. Some have hair hanging down to the
calf of the leg, twisted and entangled into knots, like the coats of
our shaggy dogs. I have seen several who hold one, and some who hold
both arms perpetually lifted above the head, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>the
nails of their hands being twisted and longer than half my little
finger, with which I measured them. Their arms are as small and thin as
the arms of persons who die in a decline, because in so forced and
unnatural a position they receive not sufficient nourishment, nor can
they be lowered so as to supply the mouth with food, the muscles having
become contracted, and the articulations dry and stiff. Novices wait
upon these fanatics and pay them the utmost respect, as persons endowed
with extraordinary sanctity. No fury in the infernal regions can be
conceived more horrible than the Jogis, with their naked and black
skin, long hair, spindle arms, long twisted nails, and fixed in the
posture which I have mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have often met, generally in the territory of some
R&#257;ja, bands of these naked Fak&#299;rs, hideous to behold. Some
have their arms lifted up in the manner just described; the frightful
hair of others either hung loosely or was tied and twisted round their
heads; some carried a club like the Hercules, others had a dry and
rough tiger-skin thrown over their shoulders. In this trim I have seen
them shamelessly walk stark naked through a large town, men, women, and
girls looking at them without any more emotion than may be created when
a hermit passes through our streets. Females would often bring them
alms with much devotion, doubtless believing that they were holy
personages, more chaste and discreet than other men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several of these Fak&#299;rs undertake long pilgrimages not
only naked but laden with heavy iron chains, such as are put about the
legs of elephants. I have seen others who, in consequence of a
particular vow, stood upright during seven or eight days without once
sitting or lying down, and without any other support than might be
afforded by leaning forward against a cord for a few hours in the
night; their legs in the meantime were swollen to the size of their
thighs. Others, again, I have observed standing steadily, whole hours
together, upon their hands, the head down and the feet in the air. I
might proceed to enumerate various other positions in which these
unhappy men place their body, many of them so difficult and painful
that they could not be imitated by our tumblers; and all this, let it
be recollected <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=

of which there is not so much as the shadow in any part of the
Indies.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">5. Resort to them for oracles.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The forest ascetics were credited with prophetic
powers, and were resorted to by Hindu princes to obtain omens and
oracles on the brink of any important undertaking. This custom is
noticed by Colonel Tod in the following passage describing the
foundation of Jodhpur:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7909src" href=
"#xd21e7909" name="xd21e7909src">10</a> &ldquo;Like the Druids of the
cells, the <i>vana-perist</i> Jogis, from the glades of the forest
(<i>vana</i>) or recess in the rocks (<i>gopha</i>), issue their
oracles to those whom chance or design may conduct to their solitary
dwellings. It is not surprising that the mandates of such beings prove
compulsory on the superstitious R&#257;jp&#363;t; we do not mean those
squalid ascetics who wander about India and are objects disgusting to
the eye, but the genuine Jogi, he who, as the term imports, mortifies
the flesh, till the wants of humanity are restricted merely to what
suffices to unite matter with spirit, who had studied and comprehended
the mystic works and pored over the systems of philosophy, until the
full influence of <i>Maia</i> (illusion) has perhaps unsettled his
understanding; or whom the rules of his sect have condemned to penance
and solitude; a penance so severe that we remain astonished at the
perversity of reason which can submit to it. We have seen one of these
objects, self-condemned never to lie down during forty years, and there
remained but three to complete the term. He had travelled much, was
intelligent and learned, but, far from having contracted the moroseness
of the recluse, there was a benignity of mien and a suavity and
simplicity of manner in him quite enchanting. He talked of his penance
with no vainglory and of its approaching term without any sensation.
The resting position of this Druid (<i>vana-perist</i>) was by means of
a rope suspended from the bough of a tree in the manner of a swing,
having a cross-bar, on which he reclined. The first years of this
penance, he says, were dreadfully painful; swollen limbs affected him
to that degree that he expected death, but this impression had long
since worn off. To these, the Druids of India, the prince and the
chieftain would resort for instruction. Such was the ascetic who
recommended <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>Joda to erect his castle of Jodhpur on the
&lsquo;Hill of Strife&rsquo; (Jodag&#299;r), a projecting elevation of
the same range on which Mundore was placed, and about four miles south
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">6. Divisions of the order.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">About 15,000 Jogis were returned from the Central
Provinces in 1911. They are said to be divided into twelve Panths or
orders, each of which venerates one of the twelve disciples of
Gorakhn&#257;th. But, as a rule, they do not know the names of the
Panths. Their main divisions are the Kanphata and Aughar Jogis. The
Kanphatas,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7945src" href="#xd21e7945" name=
"xd21e7945src">11</a> as the name denotes, pierce their ears and wear
in them large rings (<i>mundra</i>), generally of wood, stone or glass;
the ears of a novice are pierced by the Guru, who gets a fee of Rs.
1&ndash;4. The earring must thereafter always be worn, and should it be
broken must be replaced temporarily by a model in cloth before food is
taken. If after the ring has been inserted the ear tears apart, they
say that the man has become useless, and in former times he was buried
alive. Now he is put out of caste, and no tomb is erected over him when
he dies. It is said that a man cannot become a Kanphata all at once,
but must first serve an apprenticeship of twelve years as an Aughar,
and then if his Guru is satisfied he will be initiated as a Kanphata.
The elect among the Kanphatas are known as Darshani. These do not go
about begging, but remain in the forest in a cave or other abode, and
the other Jogis go there and pay their respects; this is called
<i>darshan</i>, the term used for visiting a temple and worshipping the
idol. These men only have cooked food when their disciples bring it to
them, otherwise they live on fruits and roots. The Aughars do not
pierce their ears, but have a string of black sheep&rsquo;s wool round
the neck to which is suspended a wooden whistle called <i>nadh</i>;
this is blown morning and evening and before meals.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7960src" href="#xd21e7960" name="xd21e7960src">12</a> The
names of the Kanphatas end in N&#257;th and those of the Aughars in
D&#257;s.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">7. Hair and clothes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When a novice is initiated all the hair of his head is
shaved, including the scalp-lock. If the Ganges is at hand the Guru
throws the hair into the Ganges, giving a great feast to celebrate the
occasion; otherwise he keeps the hair in his wallet until he and his
disciple reach the Ganges and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251"
href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>then throws it into the river
and gives the feast. After this the Jogi lets all his hair grow until
he comes to some great shrine, when he shaves it off clean and gives it
as an offering to the god. The Jogis wear clothes coloured with red
ochre like the Jangams, Sanni&#257;sis and all the Sivite orders. The
reddish colour perhaps symbolises blood and may denote that the wearers
still sacrifice flesh and consume it. The Vaishnavite orders usually
wear white clothes, and hence the Jogis call themselves L&#257;l
P&#257;dris (red priests), and they call the Vaishnava mendicants
S&#299;ta P&#257;dris, apparently because S&#299;ta is the consort of
R&#257;ma, the incarnation of Vishnu. When a Jogi is initiated the Guru
gives him a single bead of <i>rudr&#257;ksha</i> wood which he wears on
a string round his neck. He is not branded, but afterwards, if he
visits the temple of Dw&#257;rka in Gujar&#257;t, he is branded with
the mark of the conch-shell on the arm; or if he goes on pilgrimage to
the shrine of Badri-N&#257;r&#257;yan in the Him&#257;layas he is
branded on the chest. Copper bangles are brought from
Badri-N&#257;r&#257;yan and iron ones from the shrine of
Ked&#257;rn&#257;th. A necklace of small white stones, like
ju&#257;ri-seeds, is obtained from the temple of Hingl&#257;j in the
territories of the J&#257;m of L&#257;sbela in Beluchist&#257;n. During
his twelve years&rsquo; period as a Brahmachari or acolyte, a Jogi will
make either one or three <i>parikramas</i> of the Nerbudda; that is, he
walks from the mouth at Broach to the source at Amarkantak on one side
of the river and back again on the other side, the journey usually
occupying about three years. During each journey he lets his hair grow
and at the end of it makes an offering of all except the <i>choti</i>
or scalp-lock to the river. Even as a full Jogi he still retains the
scalp-lock, and this is not finally shaved off until he turns into a
Sanni&#257;si or forest recluse. Other Jogis, however, do not merely
keep the scalp-lock but let their hair grow, plaiting it with ropes of
black wool over their heads into what is called the <i>jata</i>, that
is an imitation of Siva&rsquo;s matted locks.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">8. Burial.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Jogis are buried sitting cross-legged with the
face to the north in a tomb which has a recess like those of
Muhammadans. A gourd full of milk and some bread in a wallet, a crutch
and one or two earthen vessels are placed in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>the
grave for the sustenance of the soul. Salt is put on the body and a
ball of wheat-flour is laid on the breast of the corpse and then
deposited on the top of the grave.</p>

<h3 class="main">9. Festivals.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Jogis worship Siva, and their principal festival
is the Shivr&#257;tri, when they stay awake all night and sing songs in
honour of Gorakhn&#257;th, the founder of their order. On the
N&#257;g-Panchmi day they venerate the cobra and they take about snakes
and exhibit them.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">10. Caste subdivisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A large proportion of the Jogis have now developed
into a caste, and these marry and have families. They are divided into
subcastes according to the different professions they have adopted.
Thus the Barwa or G&#257;rpag&#257;ri Jogis ward off hailstorms from
the standing crops; the Manih&#257;ri are pedlars and travel about to
baz&#257;rs selling various small articles; the R&#299;tha
Bikan&#257;th prepare and sell soap-nut for washing clothes; the
Patbina make hempen thread and gunny-bags for carrying grain on
bullocks; and the Ladaim&#257;r hunt jackals and sell and eat their
flesh. These Jogis rank as a low Hindu caste of the menial group. No
good Hindu caste will take food or water from them, while they will
accept cooked food from members of any caste of respectable position,
as Kurmis, Kunbis or M&#257;lis. A person belonging to any such caste
can also be admitted into the Jogi community. Their social customs
resemble those of the cultivating castes of the locality. They permit
widow-marriage and divorce and employ Br&#257;hmans for their
ceremonies, with the exception of the Kanphatas, who have priests of
their own order.</p>

<div id="xd21e8007" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">11. Begging.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Begging is the traditional occupation of the Jogis,
but they have now adopted many others. The Kanphatas beg and sell a
woollen string amulet (<i>ganda</i>), which is put round the necks of
children to protect them from the evil eye. They beg only from Hindus
and use the cry &lsquo;<i>Alakh</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;The invisible
one.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8018src" href="#xd21e8018" name=
"xd21e8018src">14</a> The Nandia Jogis lead about with them a deformed
ox, an animal with five legs or some other malformation. He is
decorated with ochre-coloured rags and cowrie shells. They call him
Nandi or the bull on which Mah&#257;deo rides, and receive gifts of
grain from pious Hindus, half of which they put into their wallet and
give the other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>half to the animal. They usually carry on a more
profitable business than other classes of beggars. The ox is trained to
give a blessing to the benevolent by shaking its head and raising its
leg when its master receives a gift.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8026src" href="#xd21e8026" name="xd21e8026src">15</a> Some of the
Jogis of this class carry about with them a brush of peacock&rsquo;s
feathers which they wave over the heads of children afflicted with the
evil eye or of sick persons, muttering texts. This performance is known
as <i>jh&#257;rna</i> (sweeping), and is the commonest method of
casting out evil spirits.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">12. Other occupations.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many Jogis have also adopted secular occupations, as
has already been seen. Of these the principal are the Manih&#257;ri
Jogis or pedlars, who retail small hand-mirrors, spangles,
dyeing-powders, coral beads and imitation jewellery, pens, pencils, and
other small articles of stationery. They also bring pearls and coral
from Bombay and sell them in the villages. The G&#257;rpag&#257;ris,
who protect the crops from hailstorms, have now become a distinct caste
and are the subject of a separate article. Others make a living by
juggling and conjuring, and in Saugor some Jogis perform the three-card
trick in the village markets, employing a confederate who advises
customers to pick out the wrong card. They also play the English game
of Sandown, which is known as &lsquo;Animur,&rsquo; from the practice
of calling out &lsquo;Any more&rsquo; as a warning to backers to place
their money on the board before beginning to turn the fish.</p>

<h3 class="main">13. Swindling practices.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These people also deal in ornaments of base metal and
practise other swindles. One of their tricks is to drop a ring or
ornament of counterfeit gold on the road. Then they watch until a
stranger picks it up and one of them goes up to him and says, &ldquo;I
saw you pick up that gold ring, it belongs to so-and-so, but if you
will make it worth my while I will say nothing about it.&rdquo; The
finder is thus often deluded into giving him some hush-money and the
Jogis decamp with this, having incurred no risk in connection with the
spurious metal. They also pretend to be able to convert silver and
other metals into gold. They ingratiate themselves with the women,
sometimes of a number of households in one village or town, giving at
first small quantities of gold in exchange for silver, and binding them
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>secrecy. Then each is told to give them all the
ornaments which she desires to be converted on the same night, and
having collected as much as possible from their dupes the Jogis make
off before morning. A very favourite device some years back was to
personate some missing member of a family who had gone on a pilgrimage.
Up to within a comparatively recent period a large proportion of the
pilgrims who set out annually from all over India to visit the famous
shrines at Ben&#257;res, Jagann&#257;th and other places perished by
the way from privation or disease, or were robbed and murdered, and
never heard of again by their families. Many households in every town
and village were thus in the position of having an absent member of
whose fate they were uncertain. Taking advantage of this, and having
obtained all the information he could pick up among the neighbours, the
Jogi would suddenly appear in the character of the returned wanderer,
and was often successful in keeping up the imposture for
years.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8048src" href="#xd21e8048" name=

they have nothing else to break; <i>Jogi jugat j&#257;ni nah&#299;n,

magic, what is the use of his dyeing his clothes?&rsquo; <i>Jogi ka

<h3 class="main">1. The village priest and astrologer.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Joshi</b>, <b>Jyotishi</b>, <b>Bhadri</b>,
<b>Parsai</b>.&mdash;The caste of village priests and astrologers. They
numbered about 6000 persons in 1911, being distributed over all
Districts. The Joshis are nearly all Br&#257;hmans, but have now
developed into a separate caste and marry among themselves. Their
social customs resemble those of Br&#257;hmans, and need not be
described in detail. The Joshi officiates at weddings in the village,
selects auspicious names for children according to the <i>nakshatra</i>
or constellation of the moon under which they were born, and points out
the auspicious time or <i>mah&#363;rat</i> for all such ceremonies and
for the commencement of agricultural operations. He is also sometimes
in charge of the village temples. He is supported by the contributions
from the villagers, and often has a plot of land rent-free from the
proprietor. The social position of the Joshis is not very good, and,
though Br&#257;hmans, they are considered to rank somewhat below the
cultivating castes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256"
name="pb256">256</a>]</span>the Kurmis and Kunbis, by whose patronage
they are supported.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8219src" href=
"#xd21e8219" name="xd21e8219src">1</a></p>
<p>The Bhadris are a class of Joshis who wander about and live by
begging, telling fortunes and giving omens. They avert the evil
influences of the planet Saturn and accept the gifts offered to this
end, which are always black, as black blankets, charcoal, <i>tilli</i>
or sesamum oil, the <i>urad</i> pulse,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8232src" href="#xd21e8232" name="xd21e8232src">2</a> and iron.
People born on Saturday or being otherwise connected with the planet
are especially subject to his malign influence. The Joshi ascertains
who these unfortunate persons are from their horoscopes, and
neutralises the evil influence of the planet by the acceptance of the
gifts already mentioned, while he sometimes also receives a buffalo or
a cow. He computes by astrological calculations the depth at which
water will be found when a cultivator wishes to dig a well. He also
practises palmistry, classifying the whorls of the fingers into two
patterns, called the Shank or conch-shell and Chakra or discus of
Vishnu. The Shank is considered to be unfortunate and the Chakra
fortunate. The lines on the balls of the toes and on the forehead are
similarly classified. When anything has been lost or stolen the Joshi
can tell from the daily <i>nakshatra</i> or mansion of the moon in
which the loss or theft occurred whether the property has gone to the
north, south, east or west, and within what interval it is likely to be
found. The people have not nowadays much faith in his prophetic powers,
and they say, &ldquo;If clouds come on Friday, and the sky is black on
Saturday, then the Joshi foretells that it will rain on Sunday.&rdquo;
The Joshi&rsquo;s calculations are all based on the <i>r&#257;shis</i>
or signs of the zodiac through which the sun passes during the year,
and the <i>nakshatras</i> or those which mark the monthly revolutions
of the moon. These are given in all Hindu almanacs, and most Joshis
simply work from the almanac, being quite ignorant of astronomy. Since
the measurement of the sun&rsquo;s apparent path on the ecliptic, and
the moon&rsquo;s orbit mapped out by the constellations are of some
interest, and govern the arrangement of the Hindu calendar, it has been
thought desirable to give some account of them. And in order to make
this intelligible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257"
name="pb257">257</a>]</span>it is desirable first to recapitulate some
elementary facts of astronomy.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">2. The apparent path of the sun. The ecliptic or
zodiac.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The universe may be conceived for the purpose of
understanding the sun&rsquo;s path among the stars as if it were a huge
ball, of which looking from the earth&rsquo;s surface we see part of
the inside with the stars marked on it, as on the inside of a dome.
This imaginary inside of a ball is called the celestial sphere, and the
ancients believed that it actually existed, and also, in order to
account for the varying distances of the stars, supposed that there
were several of them, one inside the other, and each with a number of
stars fixed to it. The sun and earth may be conceived as smaller solid
balls suspended inside this large one. Then looking from the surface of
the earth we see the sun outlined against the inner surface of the
imaginary celestial sphere. And as the earth travels round the sun in
its orbit, the appearance to us is that the sun moves over the surface
of the celestial sphere. The following figure will make this
clear.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8253src" href="#xd21e8253" name=
"xd21e8253src">3</a></p>
<div class="figure xd21e8260width"><img src="images/fig257.png" alt=
"Fig. 1.&mdash;The Orbit of the Earth and the Zodiac." width="374"
height="361">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;The Orbit
of the Earth and the Zodiac.</p>
</div>
<p>Thus when the earth is at A in its orbit the sun will appear to be
at M, and as the earth travels from A to B the sun will appear to move
from M to N on the line of the ecliptic. It will be seen that as the
earth in a year makes a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href=
"#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>complete circuit round the sun,
the sun will appear to have made a complete circuit among the stars,
and have come back to its original position. This apparent movement is
annual, and has nothing to do with the sun&rsquo;s apparent diurnal
course over the sky, which is caused by the earth&rsquo;s daily
rotation on its axis. The sun&rsquo;s annual path among the stars
naturally cannot be observed during the day. Professor Newcomb says:
&ldquo;But the fact of the motion will be made very clear if, day after
day, we watch some particular fixed star in the west. We shall find
that it sets earlier and earlier every day; in other words, it is
getting continually nearer and nearer the sun. More exactly, since the
real direction of the star is unchanged, the sun seems to be
approaching the star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could see the stars in the daytime all round the sun,
the case would be yet clearer. We should see that if the sun and a star
were together in the morning, the sun would, during the day, gradually
work past the star in an easterly direction. Between the rising and
setting it would move nearly its own diameter, relative to the star.
Next morning we should see that it had got quite away from the star,
being nearly two diameters distant from it. This motion would continue
month after month. At the end of the year the sun would have made a
complete circuit relative to the star, and we should see the two once
more together. This apparent motion of the sun in one year round the
celestial sphere was noticed by the ancients, who took much trouble to
map it out. They imagined a line passing round the celestial sphere,
which the sun always followed in its annual course, and which was
called the ecliptic. They noticed that the planets followed nearly the
same course as the sun among the stars. A belt extending on each side
of the ecliptic, and broad enough to contain all the known planets, as
well as the sun, was called the <i>zodiac</i>. It was divided into
twelve signs, each marked by a constellation. The sun went through each
sign in a month, and through all twelve signs in a year. Thus arose the
familiar signs of the zodiac, which bore the same names as the
constellations among which they are situated. This is not the case at
present, owing to the precession of the equinoxes.&rdquo; It
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>was by observing the paths of the sun and moon
round the celestial sphere along the zodiac that the ancients came to
be able to measure the solar and lunar months and years.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Inclination of the ecliptic to the equator.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As is well known, the celestial sphere is imagined to
be spanned by an imaginary line called the celestial equator, which is
in the same plane as the earth&rsquo;s equator, and as it were, a vast
concentric circle. The points in the celestial sphere opposite the
north and south terrestrial poles are called the north and south
celestial poles, and the celestial equator is midway between these.
Owing to the special form of the earth the north celestial pole is
visible to us in the northern hemisphere, and marked very nearly by the
pole-star, its height above the horizon being equal to the latitude of
the place where the observer stands. Owing to the daily rotation of the
earth the whole celestial sphere seems to revolve daily on the axis of
the north and south celestial poles, carrying the sun, moon and stars
with it. To this the apparent daily course of the sun and moon is due.
Their course seems to us oblique, as we are north of the equator.</p>
<p>If the earth&rsquo;s axis were set vertically to the plane of its
orbit round the sun, then it would follow that the plane of the equator
would pass through the centre of the sun, and that the line drawn by
the sun in its apparent revolution against the background of the
celestial sphere would be in the same plane. That is, the sun would
seem to move round a circle in the heavens in the same plane as the
earth&rsquo;s equator, or round the celestial equator. But the
earth&rsquo;s axis is inclined at 23&frac12;&deg; to the plane of its
orbit, and therefore the apparent path traced by the sun in the
celestial sphere, which is the same path as the earth would really
follow to an observer on the surface of the sun, is inclined at
23&frac12;&deg; to the celestial equator. This is the ecliptic, and is
really the line of the plane of the earth&rsquo;s orbit extended to cut
the celestial sphere.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All the planets move round the sun in orbits whose
planes are slightly inclined to that of the earth, the plane of Mercury
having the greatest inclination of 6&deg;. The plane of the
moon&rsquo;s orbit round the earth is also inclined at 5&deg; 9&prime;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>to the ecliptic. The orbits of the moon and all
the planets must necessarily intersect the plane of the earth&rsquo;s
orbit on the ecliptic at two points, and these are called the nodes of
the moon and each planet respectively. In consequence of the
inclination being so slight, though the course of the moon and planets
is not actually on the ecliptic, they are all so close to it that they
are included in the belt of the zodiac. Thus the moon and all the
planets follow almost the same apparent course on the zodiac or belt
round the ecliptic in the changes of position resulting from their own
and the earth&rsquo;s orbital movements with reference to what are
called the fixed stars.</p>

<p class="first">As the sun completes his circuit of the ecliptic or
zodiac in the course of a year, it followed that if his course could be
measured and divided into periods, these periods would form divisions
of time for the year. This was what the ancients did, and it is
probable that the measurement and division of time was the primary
object of the science of astronomy, as apart from the natural curiosity
to ascertain the movements of the sun, moon and planets, when they were
looked upon as divine beings controlling the world. They divided the
zodiac or the path of the sun into twelve parts, and gave to each part
the name of the principal constellation situated on, or adjacent to,
that section of the line of the ecliptic. When they had done this and
observed the dates of the sun&rsquo;s entry into each sign or
<i>r&#257;shi</i>, as it is called in Hindi, they had divided the year
into twelve solar months. The following are the Hindu names and

<p>The signs of the zodiac were nearly the same among the Greeks,
Egyptians, Persians, Babylonians and Indians. They are supposed to have
originated in Chaldea or Babylonia, and the fact that the
constellations are indicated by nearly the same symbols renders their
common origin probable. It seems likely that the existing Hindu zodiac
may have been adopted from the Greeks.</p>

<h3 class="main">7. The <i>nakshatras</i> or constellations of the
moon&rsquo;s path.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Sankr&#257;nts do not mark the commencement of the
Hindu months, which are still lunar and are adjusted to the solar year
by intercalation. It is probable that long before they were able to
measure the sun&rsquo;s progress along the ecliptic the ancients had
observed that of the moon, which it was much easier to do, as she is
seen among the stars at night. Similarly there is little reason to
doubt that the first division of time was the lunar month, which can be
remarked by every one. Ancient astronomers measured the progress of the
moon&rsquo;s path along the ecliptic and divided it into twenty-seven
sections, each of which represented roughly a day&rsquo;s march. Each
section was distinguished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href=
"#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>by a group of stars either on the
ecliptic or so near it, either in the northern or southern hemisphere,
as to be occultated by the moon or capable of being in conjunction with
it or the planets. These constellations are called <i>nakshatras</i>.
Naturally, some of these constellations are the same as those
subsequently chosen to mark the sun&rsquo;s path or the signs of the
zodiac. In some cases a zodiacal constellation is divided into two
<i>nakshatras</i>. Like the signs, the <i>nakshatras</i> were held to
represent animals or natural objects. The following is a list of them
with their corresponding stars, and the object which each was supposed
to represent:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8440src" href="#xd21e8440"

<h3 class="main">8. The revolution of the moon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All the zodiacal constellations are thus included in
the <i>nakshatras</i> except Capricorn, for which Aquila and Delphinis
are substituted. These, as well as Hydra, are a considerable distance
from the ecliptic, but may perhaps be nearer the moon&rsquo;s path,
which, as already seen, slightly diverges from it. But this point has
not been ascertained by me. The moon completes the circuit of the
heavens in its orbit round the earth in a little less than a lunar
month or 27 days 8 hours. As twenty-seven <i>nakshatras</i> were
demarcated, it seems clear that a <i>nakshatra</i> was meant to
represent the distance travelled by the moon in a day. Subsequently a
twenty-eighth small <i>nakshatra</i> was formed called Abhijit, out of
Uttar&#257;sh&#257;dha and Sravana, and this may have been meant to
represent the fractional part of the day. The days of the lunar month
have each, as a matter of fact, a <i>nakshatra</i> allotted to them,
which is recorded in all Hindu almanacs, and enters largely into the
Joshi&rsquo;s astrological calculations. It may have been the case that
prior to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>naming of the days of the week, the days of the
lunar month were distinguished by the names of their <i>nakshatras</i>,
but this could only have been among the learned. For though there was a
<i>nakshatra</i> for every day of the moon&rsquo;s path round the
ecliptic, the same days in successive months could not have the same
<i>nakshatras</i> on account of what is called the synodical revolution
of the moon. The light of the moon comes from the sun, and we see only
that part of it which is illuminated by the sun. When the moon is
between the earth and the sun, the light hemisphere is invisible to us,
and there is no moon. When the moon is on the opposite side of the
earth to the sun we see the whole of the illuminated hemisphere, and it
is full moon. Thus in the time between one new moon and the next, the
moon must proceed from its position between the earth and the sun to
the same position again, and to do this it has to go somewhat more than
once round the ecliptic, as is shown by the following figure.<a class=

<p class="first">As during the moon&rsquo;s circuit of the earth, the
earth is also travelling on its orbit, the moon will not be between the
earth and the sun again on completion of its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>orbit, but will have to traverse the further arc
shown in the figure to come between the earth and the sun. When the
moon has completed the circle of the ecliptic from the position ME, its
position relative to the earth has become as NF and it has not yet come
between the earth and the sun. Hence while the moon completes the
circuit of the ecliptic<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9105src" href=
"#xd21e9105" name="xd21e9105src">7</a> in 27 days 8 hours, the time
from one new moon to another is 29 days 13 hours. Hence the
<i>nakshatras</i> will not fall on the same days in successive lunar
months, and would not be suitable as names for the days. It seems that,
recognising this, the ancient astronomers had to find other names. They
had the lunar fortnights of 14 or 15 days from new to full and full to
new moon. Hence apparently they hit on the plan of dividing these into
half and regulating the influence which the sun, moon and planets were
believed to exercise over events in the world by allotting one day to
each of them. They knew of five planets besides the sun and moon, and
by giving a day to each of them the seven-day week was formed. The term
planet signifies a wanderer, and it thus perhaps seemed suitable that
they should give their names to the days which would revolve endlessly
in a cycle, as they themselves did in the heavens. The names of the
days are:</p>

<p>The termination <i>v&#257;ra</i> means a day. The weekdays were

named after the sun, moon and Saturn, but four, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday, are called after Scandinavian deities, the last
three being Woden or Odin, Thor and Freya. I do not know whether these
were identified with the planets. It is supposed that the Hindus

of the lunar month, which was the nearest that could be got. The first
method of measuring the year would be by twelve lunar months, which
would bring it back nearly to the same period. But as the lunar month
is 29 days 13 hours, twelve months would be 354 days 12 hours, or
nearly eleven days less than the tropical solar year. Hence if the
lunar year was retained the months would move back round the year by
about eleven days annually. This is what actually happens in the
Muhammadan calendar where the twelve lunar months have been retained
and the Muharram and other festivals come earlier every year by about
eleven days.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In order to reconcile the lunar and solar years the
Hindus hit upon an ingenious device. It was ordained that any month in
which the sun did not enter a new sign of the zodiac would not count
and would be followed by another month of the same name. Thus in the
month of Chait the sun must enter the sign Mesha or Aries. If he does
not enter it during the lunar month there will be an intercalary Chait,
followed by the proper month of the same name during which the sun will
enter Mesha.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9186src" href="#xd21e9186"
name="xd21e9186src">9</a> Such an intercalary month is called Adhika.
An intercalary month, obtained by having two successive lunar months of
the same name, occurs approximately once in three years, and by this
means the reckoning by twelve lunar months is adjusted to the solar
year. On the other hand, the sun very occasionally passes two
Sankr&#257;nts or enters into two fresh signs during the lunar month.
This is rendered possible by the fact that the time occupied by the sun
in passing through different signs of the zodiac varies to some extent.
It is said that the zodiac was divided into twelve equal signs of
30&deg; each or 1&deg; for each day, as at this period it was
considered that the year was 360 days.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9191src" href="#xd21e9191" name="xd21e9191src">10</a> Possibly in
adjusting the signs to 365 odd days some alterations may have been made
in their length, or errors discovered. At any rate, whatever may be the
reason, the length of the sun&rsquo;s periods in the signs, or of the
solar months, varies from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href=
"#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>31 days 14 hours to 29 days 8
hours. Three of the months are less than the lunar month, and hence it
is possible that two Sankr&#257;nts or passages of the sun into a fresh
sign may occasionally occur in the same lunar month. When this happens,
following the same rule as before, the month to which the second
Sankr&#257;nt properly belongs, that is the one following that in which
two Sankr&#257;nts occur, is called a Kshaya or eliminated month and is
omitted from the calendar. Intercalary months occur generally in the
3rd, 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 16th and 18th years of a cycle of nineteen
years, or seven times in nineteen years. It is found that in each
successive cycle only one or two months are changed, so that the same
month remains intercalary for several cycles of nineteen years and then
gives way generally to one of the months preceding and rarely to the
following month. Suppressed months occur at intervals varying from 19
to 141 years, and in a year when a suppressed month occurs there must
always be one intercalary month and not infrequently there are
two.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9199src" href="#xd21e9199" name=
"xd21e9199src">11</a></p>
<p>This method of adjusting the solar and lunar years, though clumsy,
is so far scientific that the solar and lunar years are made to agree
without any artificial intercalation of days. It has, however, the
great disadvantages of the frequent intercalary month, and also of the
fact that the lunar months begin on different dates in the English
solar calendar, varying by nearly twenty days.</p>

<h3 class="main">12. Superstitions about numbers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It seems not improbable that the unlucky character of
the number thirteen may have arisen from its being the number of the
intercalary month. Though the special superstition against sitting down
thirteen to a meal is, no doubt, associated particularly with the Last
Supper, the number is generally unlucky as a date and in other
connections. And this is not only the case in Europe, but the Hindus,
Persians and P&#257;rsis also consider thirteen an unlucky number; and
the Muhammadans account for a similar superstition by saying that
Muhammad was ill for the first thirteen days of the month Safar.
Twelve, as being the number of the months in the lunar and solar years,
is an auspicious number; thirteen would be one extra, and as being the
intercalary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>month would be here this year and missing next
year. Hence it might be supposed that one of thirteen persons met
together would be gone at their next meeting like the month. Similarly,
the auspicious character of the number seven may be due to its being
the total of the sun, moon and five planets, and of the days of the
week named after them. And the number three may have been invested with
mystic significance as representing the sun, moon and earth. In the
Hindu Trinity Vishnu and Siva are the sun and moon, and Brahma, who
created the earth, and has since remained quiescent, may have been the
personified representative of the earth itself.</p>

<p>Thus if the Pleiades are reckoned as part of Taurus,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9381src" href="#xd21e9381" name=
"xd21e9381src">12</a> eight zodiacal signs give their names to months
as well as Orion, Pegasus and Aquila, while two months are included in
Leo. It appears that in former times the year began with P&#363;s or
December, as the month M&#257;rgash&#299;r was also called Aghan or
Agrahana, or &lsquo;That which went before,&rsquo; that is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>the
month before the new year. But the renewal of vegetation in the spring
has exercised a very powerful effect on the primitive mind, being
marked by the Holi festival in India, corresponding to the Carnival in
Europe. The vernal equinox was thus perhaps selected as the most
important occasion and the best date for beginning the new year, which
now commences in northern India with the new moon of Chait, immediately
following the Holi festival, when the sun is in the sign of Mesha or
Aries. At first the months appear to have travelled round the year, but
subsequently they were fixed by ordaining that the month of Chait
should begin with the new moon during the course of which the sun
entered the sign Aries.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9386src" href=
"#xd21e9386" name="xd21e9386src">13</a> The constellation Chitra, from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=

<p>Consequently, the full moon, being nearly opposite the sun on the
ecliptic, would be in the sign Chitra or near it. In southern India the
months begin with the full moon, but in northern India with the new
moon; it seems possible that the months were called after the
<i>nakshatra</i>, of the full moon to distinguish them from the solar
months which would be called after the sign of the zodiac in which the
sun was. But no authoritative explanation seems to be available.
Similarly, the <i>nakshatras</i> after which the other months are
named, fall nearly opposite to them at the new moon, while the full
moon would be in or near them.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The periods during which the sun passes through each
<i>nakshatra</i> are also recorded, and they are of course constant in
date like the solar months. As there are twenty-seven
<i>nakshatras</i>, the average time spent by the sun in each is about
13&frac12; days. These periods are well known to the people as they
have the advantage of not varying in date like the lunar months, while
over most of India the solar months are not used. The commencement of
the various agricultural operations is dated by the solar
<i>nakshatras</i>, and there are several proverbs about them in
connection with the crops. The following are some examples: &ldquo;If
it does not rain in Pushya and Punarvasu Nakshatras the children of
Nim&#257;r will go without food.&rdquo; &lsquo;Rain in Magha Nakshatra
(end of August) is like food given by a mother,&rsquo; because it is so
beneficial. &ldquo;If there is no wind in Mrigasiras (beginning of
June), and no heat in Rohini (end of May), sell your plough-cattle and
go and look for work.&rdquo; &lsquo;If it rains during Uttara (end of
September) dogs will turn up their noses at grain,&rsquo; because the
harvest will be so abundant. &ldquo;If it rains during Aslesha (first
half of August) the wheat-stalks will be as stout as drum-sticks&rdquo;
(because the land will be well ploughed). &lsquo;If rain falls in
Chitra or Sw&#257;ti Nakshatras (October) there won&rsquo;t be enough
cotton for lamp-wicks.&rsquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">15. Lunar fortnights and days.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The lunar month was divided into two fortnights called
<i>paksha</i> or wing. The period of the waxing moon was known as
<i>sukla</i> or <i>sudi paksha</i>, that is the light fortnight,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>and that of the waning moon as <i>krishna</i> or
<i>budi paksha</i>, that is the dark fortnight.</p>
<p>Each lunar month was also divided into thirty equal periods, called
<i>tithis</i> or lunar days. Since there are less than thirty days in
the lunar month, a <i>tithi</i> does not correspond to an ordinary day,
but begins and ends at odd hours of the day. Nevertheless the
<i>tithis</i> are printed in all almanacs, and are used for the
calculation of auspicious moments.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9467src"

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">16. Divisions of the day.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The day is divided for ordinary purposes of measuring
time into eight <i>pahars</i> or watches, four of the day and four of
the night; and into sixty <i>gharis</i> or periods of twenty-four
minutes each. The <i>pahars</i>, however, are not of equal length. At
the equinox the first and fourth <i>pahar</i> of the day and night each
contain eight <i>gharis</i>, and the two middle ones seven
<i>gharis</i>. In summer the first and fourth <i>pahars</i> of the day
contain nine <i>gharis</i> each, and the two middle ones eight each,
while the first and fourth <i>pahars</i> of the night contain seven and
the two middle ones six each. Thus in summer the four day <i>pahars</i>
contain 13 hours 36 minutes and the night ones 10 hours 24 minutes. And
in winter the exact opposite is the case, the night <i>pahars</i> being
lengthened and the day ones shortened in precisely the same manner. No
more unsatisfactory measure of time could well be devised. The
termination of the second watch or <i>do pahar</i> always corresponds
with midday and midnight respectively.</p>
<p>The apparatus with which the hours were measured and announced
consisted of a shallow metal pan, named from its office,
<i>ghari&#257;l</i>, and suspended so as to be easily struck with a
wooden mallet by the <i>ghari&#257;li</i>. He measured the passing of a
<i>ghari</i> by an empty thin brass cup or <i>katori</i>, perforated at
the bottom, and placed on the surface of a large vessel filled with
water, where nothing could disturb it; the water came through the small
hole in the bottom of the cup and filled it, causing it to sink in the
period of one <i>ghari</i>. At the expiration of each <i>ghari</i> the
<i>ghari&#257;l</i> struck its number from one to nine with a mallet on
a brass plate, and at the end of each <i>pahar</i> he struck a
<i>gujar</i> or eight strokes to announce the fact, followed by one to
four hollow-sounding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272"
name="pb272">272</a>]</span>strokes to indicate the number of the
<i>pahar</i>. This custom is still preserved in the method by which the
police-guards of the public offices announce the hours on a gong and
subsequently strike four, eight and twelve strokes to proclaim these
hours of the day and night by our clock. Only rich men could afford to
maintain a <i>ghari&#257;l</i>, as four persons were required to attend
to it during the day and four at night.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Joshi calculates auspicious<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9572src" href="#xd21e9572" name="xd21e9572src">17</a> seasons by
a consideration of the sun&rsquo;s zodiacal sign, the moon&rsquo;s
<i>nakshatra</i> or daily mansion, and other rules. From the monthly
zodiacal signs and daily <i>nakshatras</i> in which children are born,
as recorded in their horoscopes, he calculates whether their marriage
will be auspicious. Thus the zodiacal signs are supposed to be divided
among the four castes, Pisces, Cancer and Scorpio belonging to the
Br&#257;hman; Aries, Leo and Sagittarius to the Kshatriya; Taurus,
Virgo and Capricorn to the Vaishya; and Gemini, Libra and Aquarius to
the S&#363;dra. If the boy and girl were born under any of the three
signs of the same caste it is a happy conjunction. If the boy&rsquo;s
sign was of a caste superior to the girl&rsquo;s, it is suitable, but
if the girl&rsquo;s sign is of a superior caste to the boy&rsquo;s it
is an omen that she will rule the household; and though the marriage
may take place, certain ceremonies should be performed to obviate this
effect. There is also a division of the zodiacal signs according to
their nature. Thus Virgo, Libra, Gemini, Aquarius and half of
Sagittarius are considered to be of the nature of man, or formed by
him; Aries, Taurus, half of Sagittarius and half of Capricorn are of
the nature of animals; Cancer, Pisces and half of Capricorn are of a
watery nature; Leo is of the desert or wild nature; and Scorpio is of
the nature of insects. If the boy and girl were both born under signs
of the same nature their marriage will be auspicious, but if they were
born under signs of different <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273"
href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>natures, they will share only
half the blessings and comforts of the marriage state, and may be
visited by strife, enmity, misery or distress. As Leo and Scorpio are
looked upon as being enemies, evil consequences are much dreaded from
the marriage of a couple born under these signs. There are also
numerous rules regarding the <i>nakshatras</i> or mansions of the moon
and days of the week under which the boy and girl were born, but these
need not be reproduced. If on the day of the wedding the sun or any of
the planets passes from one zodiacal sign to another, the wedding must
be delayed for a certain number of <i>gharis</i> or periods of
twenty-four minutes, the number varying for each planet. The hours of
the day are severally appointed to the seven planets and the twelve
zodiacal signs, and the period of ascendancy of a sign is known as
<i>lagan</i>; this name is also given to the paper specifying the day
and hour which have been calculated as auspicious for the wedding. It
is stated that no weddings should be celebrated during the period of
occultation of the planets Jupiter and Venus, nor on the day before new
moon, nor the Sankr&#257;nt or day on which the sun passes from one
zodiacal sign to another, nor in the Singhast year, when the planet
Jupiter is in the constellation Leo. This takes place once in twelve
years. Marriages are usually prohibited during the four months of the
rainy season, and sometimes also in P&#363;s, Jeth or other months.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">18. Personal names.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Joshi names children according to the moon&rsquo;s
daily <i>nakshatra</i> under which they were born, each
<i>nakshatra</i> having a letter or certain syllables allotted to it
with which the name must begin. Thus Magha has the syllables Ma, Mi, Mu
and Me, with which the name should begin, as Mans&#257;ram, Mithu
L&#257;l, Mukund Singh, Meghn&#257;th; Purwa Ph&#257;lguni has Mo and
Te, as Moji L&#257;l and Tegi L&#257;l; Punarvasu has Ke, Ko, Ha and
Hi, as Kesho Rao, Koshal Pras&#257;d, Hardy&#257;l and H&#299;ra
L&#257;l, and so on. The primitive idea connecting a name with the
thing or person to which it belongs is that the name is actually a
concrete part of the person or object, containing part of his life,
just as the hair, nails and all the body are believed to contain part
of the life, which is not at first localised in any part of the body
nor conceived of as separate from it. The primitive mind could conceive
no abstract <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>idea, that is nothing that could not be seen or
heard, and it could not think of a name as an abstract appellation. The
name was thought of as part of that to which it was applied. Thus, if
one knew a man&rsquo;s name, it was thought that one could use it to
injure him, just as if one had a piece of his hair or nails he could be
injured through them because they all contained part of his life; and
if a part of the life was injured or destroyed the remainder would also
suffer injury, just as the whole body might perish if a limb was cut
off. For this reason savages often conceal their real names, so as to
prevent an enemy from obtaining power to injure them through its
knowledge. By a development of the same belief it was thought that the
names of gods and saints contained part of the divine life and potency
of the god or saint to whom they were applied. And even separated from
the original owner the name retained that virtue which it had acquired
in association; hence the power assigned to the names of gods and
superhuman beings when used in spells and incantations. Similarly, if
the name of a god or saint was given to a child it was thought that
some part of the nature and virtue of the god might be conferred on the
child. Thus Hindu children are most commonly named after gods and
goddesses under the influence of this idea; and though the belief may
now have decayed the practice continues. Similarly the common
Muhammadan names are epithets of Allah or god or of the Prophet and his
relations. Jewish children are named after the Jewish patriarchs. In
European countries the most common male names are those of the
Apostles, as John, Peter, James, Paul, Simon, Andrew and Thomas; and
the names of the Evangelists were, until recently, also given. The most
common girl&rsquo;s name in several European countries is Mary, and a
generation or two ago other Biblical names, as Sarah, Hannah, Ruth,
Rachel, and so on, were very usually given to girls. In England the
names next in favour for boys and girls are those of kings and queens,
and the same idea perhaps originally underlay the application of these
names. The following are some of the best-known Hindu names, taken from
those of gods:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href=

<p>If a girl is born after four sons she will be called Pancho or
fifth, and one born in the unlucky Mul Nakshatra is called Mulia. When
a girl is married and goes to her husband&rsquo;s house her name is
always changed there. If two girls have been married into the
household, they may be called Bari Bohu and Choti Bohu, or the elder
and younger daughters-in-law; or a girl may be called after the place
from which she comes, as Jabalpurw&#257;li, Raipurw&#257;li, and so

<h3 class="main">21. Special names and bad names.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The higher castes have two names, one given by the
Joshi, which is called <i>r&#257;shi-ka-n&#257;m</i> or the ceremonial
name, <i>r&#257;shi</i> meaning the Nakshatra or moon&rsquo;s daily
mansion under which the child was born. This is kept secret and only
used in marriage and other ceremonies, though the practice is now
tending to decay. The other is the <i>chaltu</i> or current name, and
may either be a second ordinary name, such as those already given, or
it may be taken from some peculiarity of the child. Names of the latter
class are: Bh&#363;ra, brown; Putro, a doll, given to a pretty child;
Duk&#257;li, born in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279"
name="pb279">279</a>]</span>famine-time; Mahinga, dear or expensive;
Chhota, little; B&#257;bu, equivalent to little prince or noble;
P&#257;pa, father; Kakku, born in the cucumber season; Lada, pet;
Pattu, a somersault; Jud&#257;wan, cooling, and so on. Bad names are
also given to avert ill-luck and remove the enmity of the spirits
hostile to children, if the mother&rsquo;s previous babies have been
lost. Instances of these are Raisa, short in stature; L&#363;la, having
a maimed arm; Ghas&#299;ta, dragged along on a board; Damru, bought for
a farthing; Khair&#257;ti, alms; Dukhi, pain; Kubra, hunch-back; Gudri,
rag; K&#257;na, one-eyed; Birla, thin or lean; Bis&#257;hu, bought or
purchased; and Bul&#257;ki and Chedi, having a pierced nostril; these
names are given to a boy whose nostril has been pierced to make him
resemble a girl and thus decrease his value.<a class="noteref" id=

the precession of the equinoxes, the sidereal year is not the same as
the solar year, being about 20 minutes longer. That is, the sun passes
a particular star a second time in a period of 365 days 6 hours and 9
minutes, while it passes the equatorial point in 365 days 5 hours 48
minutes 49 seconds, this latter period being the solar year. The
difference is due to slight changes in the direction of the
earth&rsquo;s axis, which change the position of the celestial equator
and of the equinoctial point where the sun crosses it. It is not clear
how the Hindus get over this difficulty, but the point does not affect
the general account.</p>

<h2 class="main">Jul&#257;ha</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Jul&#257;ha</b>, <b>Momin</b>.&mdash;A low
Muhammadan caste of weavers resident mainly in Saugor and
Burh&#257;npur. They numbered about 4000 persons in 1911. In
N&#257;gpur District the Muhammadan weavers generally call themselves
Momin, a word meaning &lsquo;orthodox.&rsquo; In northern India and
Bengal Jul&#257;has are very numerous and the bulk of them are probably
converted Hindus. Mr. (Sir Denzil) Ibbetson remarks: &ldquo;We find
Koli-Jul&#257;has, Cham&#257;r-Jul&#257;has, Morhi-Jul&#257;has,
Ramd&#257;si-Jul&#257;has, and so forth; and it is probable that after
a few generations these men will drop the prefix which denotes their
low origin and become Jul&#257;has pure and simple.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9810src" href="#xd21e9810" name="xd21e9810src">1</a>
The Jul&#257;has claim Adam as the founder of their craft, inasmuch as
when Satan made him realise his nakedness he taught the art of weaving
to his sons. And they say that their ancestors came from Arabia. In
Nim&#257;r the Jul&#257;has or Momins assert that they do not permit
outsiders to be admitted as members of the caste, but the accuracy of
this is doubtful, while in Saugor any Muhammadan who wishes to do so
may become a Jul&#257;ha. They follow the Muhammadan laws of marriage
and inheritance. Unions between relatives are favoured, but a man may
not marry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>his sister, niece, aunt or foster-sister. The
Jul&#257;ha or Momin women observe no <i>purda</i>, and are said to be
almost unique among Muhammadans in this respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Musalm&#257;n<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9822src" href=
"#xd21e9822" name="xd21e9822src">2</a> weaver or Jul&#257;ha,&rdquo;
Sir G. Grierson writes, &ldquo;is the proverbial fool of Hindu stories
and proverbs. He swims in the moonlight across fields of flowering
linseed, thinking the blue colour to be caused by water. He hears his
family priest reading the Kor&#257;n, and bursts into tears to the
gratification of the reader. When pressed to tell what part affected
him most, he says it was not that, but that the wagging beard of the
old gentleman so much reminded him of a favourite goat of his which had
died. When forming one of a company of twelve he tries to count them
and finding himself missing wants to perform his own funeral obsequies.
He finds the rear peg of a plough and wants to set up farming on the
strength of it. He gets into a boat at night and forgets to pull up the
anchor. After rowing till dawn he finds himself where he started, and
concludes that the only explanation is that his native village could
not bear to lose him and has followed him. If there are eight weavers
and nine huqqas, they fight for the odd one. Once on a time a crow
carried off to the roof of the house some bread which a weaver had
given his child. Before giving the child any more he took the
precaution of removing the ladder. Like the English fool he always gets
unmerited blows. For instance, he once went to see a ram-fight and got
butted himself, as the saying runs:</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e4473">
<p class="line">Karigah chhor tam&#257;sa jay</p>
<p class="line">Nahak chot Jul&#257;ha khay.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;He left his loom to see the fun and for no
reason got a bruising.&rsquo; Another story (told by Fallon) is that
being told by a soothsayer that it was written in his fate that his
nose would be cut off with an axe, the weaver was incredulous and
taking up an axe, kept flourishing it, saying&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter xd21e4473">
<p class="line">Yon karba ta gor k&#257;tbon</p>
<p class="line">Yon karba ta h&#257;th k&#257;tbon</p>
<p class="line">Aur yon karba tab n&#257;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;If I do <i>so</i> I cut off my leg, if I do <i>so</i> I cut
off my hand, but unless I do <i>so</i> my no&mdash;&mdash;,&rsquo; and
his nose was off. Another proverb <i>Jul&#257;ha j&#257;nathi jo
katai</i>, &lsquo;Does a weaver know how to cut barley,&rsquo; refers
to a story (in Fallon) that a weaver unable to pay his debt was set to
cut barley by his creditor, who thought to repay himself in this way.
But instead of reaping, the stupid fellow kept trying to untwist the
tangled barley stems. Other proverbs at his expense are; &lsquo;The
Jul&#257;ha went out to cut the grass at sunset, when even the crows
were going home.&rsquo; &lsquo;The Jul&#257;ha&rsquo;s brains are in
his backside.&rsquo; His wife bears an equally bad character, as in the
proverb: &lsquo;A wilful Jul&#257;hin will pull her own father&rsquo;s
beard.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

href="#xd21e9867" name="xd21e9867src">1</a> <b>Kach&#257;ra</b> (from
<i>k&#257;nch</i>, glass).&mdash;The functional caste of makers of
glass bangles. The Kacheras numbered 2800 persons in the Central
Provinces in 1911, of whom 1800 were found in the Jubbulpore District.
The caste say that in former times glass bangles were made only by Turk
or Muhammadan Kacheras. The present name of Turk&#257;ri is probably
derived from Turk. But when Gauri P&#257;rvati was to be married to
Mah&#257;deo, she refused to wear the bangles made by a Turk&#257;ri.
So Mah&#257;deo constructed a vedi or furnace, and from this sprang the
first Hindu Kachera, who was employed to make bangles for P&#257;rvati.
A later variant of the legend, having a sufficiently obvious deduction,
is that Mah&#257;deo did not create a man, but caught hold of a
Kshatriya who happened to be present and ordered him to make the
bangles. His descendants followed the new profession and thus came to
be known as Kacheras. It is a possible conclusion from the story that
the art of making glass bangles was introduced by the Muhammadans and,
as suggested in the article on Lakhera, it may be the case that Hindu
women formerly wore ornaments made of lac.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Exogamous groups.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The exogamous sections of the Kacheras show that the
caste is of very mixed origin. Several of them are named <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>after other castes, as Bharia (forest tribe),
Gadaria (shepherd), Sun&#257;r, Naua (Nai), Thakurel (Th&#257;kur or
R&#257;jp&#363;t), Kachhw&#257;ha and Chauh&#257;n (septs of
R&#257;jp&#363;ts), and Kuria or Kori (weaver), and indicate that
members of these castes took to the profession of bangle-making and
became Kacheras. It may be surmised that, in the first instance
perhaps, when the objection to using the product of the Muhammadan
workman arose, if the theory of the prior use of lac bangles be
correct, members of different castes took to supplying bangles for
their own community, and from these in the course of time the Kachera
caste was developed. Other names of sections worth mentioning are
Jharr&#257;ha, one who frets or worries; Kharr&#257;ha, a choleric
person; Dukesha, one who carries a begging-bowl; Thuthel, a maimed man,
and Khajha, one suffering from the itch.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Social customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The exogamous sections are known as <i>baink</i>. The
marriage of persons belonging to the same section and of first cousins
is forbidden. Girls are generally married at an early age, as there is
a scarcity of women in the caste, and they are snapped up as soon as
available. As a natural consequence a considerable bride-price is paid,
and the desire of the Kachera to make a profit by the marriage of his
daughter is ridiculed in the following saying, supposed to be his
prayer: &ldquo;O God, give me a daughter. In exchange for her I shall
get a pair of bullocks and a potful of rupees, and I shall be rich for
the rest of my life. As her dowry I shall give her a sickle, a hoe and
a spinning-machine, and these will suffice for my daughter to earn her
livelihood.&rdquo; The usual sum paid for a girl is Rs. 50. The
marriage ceremony is performed by walking round the sacred pole, and
after it the couple try their strength against each other, the bride
trying to push a stone pestle on to a slab with her foot and the groom
pushing it off with his. At the end of the wedding an omen is taken, a
silver ornament known as <i>dh&#257;l</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9899src" href="#xd21e9899" name="xd21e9899src">2</a> which women
wear in the ear being fixed on to a wall and milk poured over it. If
the ornament is displaced by the stream of milk and falls down, it is
considered that the union will be a happy one. The proceeding perhaps
symbolises roughly the birth of a child. The marriage of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>widows is permitted, and in consequence of the
scarcity of women the widow is usually married to her late
husband&rsquo;s younger brother, if there be one, even though he may be
only a child. Divorce is permitted. <i>Liaisons</i> within the caste
are usually overlooked, but a woman going wrong with an outsider is
expelled from the community. The Kacheras commonly burn the dead. They
employ Br&#257;hmans for ceremonial purposes, but their social status
is low and no high caste will take water from them. They eat flesh and
fish, and some of them drink liquor, while others have given it up.
They have a caste committee or <i>panch&#257;yat</i> for the punishment
of social offences, which is headed by officials known as M&#257;lik
and D&#299;w&#257;n. Their favourite deity is Devi, and in her honour
they sow the Jawaras or pots of wheat corresponding to the gardens of
Adonis during the nine days prior to the R&#257;mnaomi and Dasahra
festivals in March and September. Some of them carry their devotion so
far as to grow the plants of wheat on their bodies, sitting in one
posture for nine days and almost giving up food and drink. At the
Diw&#257;li festival they worship the furnace in which glass bangles
are made.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Occupation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The traditional occupation of the caste is the
manufacture of glass bangles. They import the glass in lumps from
northern India and melt it in their furnace, after which the colouring
matter is applied and the ring is turned on a slab of stone. Nearly all
Hindu married women have glass bangles, which are broken or removed if
their husbands die. But the rule is not universal, and some castes do
not wear them at all. M&#257;rw&#257;ri women have bangles of ivory,
and Dhangar (shepherd) women of cocoanut-shell. Women of several castes
who engage in labour have glass bangles only on the left wrist and
metal ones on the right, as the former are too fragile. Low-caste women
sometimes wear the flat, black bangles known as <i>khagga</i> on the
upper arm. In many castes the glass bangles are also broken after the
birth of a child. Bangles of many colours are made, but Hindus usually
prefer black or indigo-blue. Among Hindus of good caste a girl may wear
green bangles while she is unmarried; at her wedding black bangles are
put on her wrists, and thereafter she may have them of black, blue, red
or yellow, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>not green. Muhammadans usually wear black or
dark-green bangles. A Hindu woman has the same number of bangles on
each wrist, not less than five and more if she likes. She will never
leave her arms entirely without bangles, as she thinks this would cause
her to become a widow. Consequently when a new set are purchased one or
two of the old ones are kept on each arm. Similarly among castes who
wear lac bangles like Banj&#257;ras, five should be worn, and these
cover the greater part of the space between the wrist and the elbow.
The men of the caste usually stay at home and make the bangles, and the
women travel about to the different village markets, carrying their
wares on little ponies if they can afford them. It is necessary that
the seller of bangles should be a woman, as she has to assist her
customers to work them on to their wrists, and also display her goods
to high-caste women behind the <i>purda</i> in their homes.</p>
<p>The Kacheras&rsquo; bangles are very cheap, from two to fourteen
being obtainable for a pice (farthing), according to quality. Many are
also broken, and the seller has to bear the loss of all those broken
when the purchaser is putting them on, which may amount to 30 per cent.
And though an improvement on the old lac bangles, the colours are very
dull, and bracelets of better and more transparent glass imported from
Austria now find a large sale and tend to oust the indigenous product.
The Kachera, therefore, is, as a rule, far from prosperous. The
incessant bending over the furnace tends to undermine his constitution
and often ruins his eyesight. There is in fact a Hindi saying to the
effect that, &ldquo;When the Kachera has a son the rejoicings are held
in the Kundera&rsquo;s (turner&rsquo;s) house. For he will go blind and
then he will find nothing else to do but turn the Kundera&rsquo;s
lathe.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>K&#257;chhi.</b>&mdash;An important cultivating
caste of the northern Districts, who grow vegetables and irrigated
crops requiring intensive cultivation. The distinction between the
K&#257;chhis and M&#257;lis of the Hindust&#257;ni Districts is that
the former grow regular irrigated crops, while the latter confine their
operations to vegetables and flower-gardens; whereas the M&#257;li or
Mar&#257;r of the Mar&#257;tha country is both a cultivator and a
gardener. The K&#257;chhis numbered about 120,000 persons in 1911, and
resided mainly in the Saugor, Damoh, Jubbulpore and Narsinghpur
Districts. The word K&#257;chhi may be derived from
<i>kachh&#257;r</i>, the name given to the alluvial land lying on river
banks, which they greatly affect for growing their vegetables. Another
derivation is from <i>k&#257;chhni</i>, a term used for the process of
collecting the opium from the capsules of the poppy.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e9979src" href="#xd21e9979" name="xd21e9979src">1</a> The caste
are probably an offshoot of the Kurmis. Owing to the resemblance of
names they claim a connection with the Kachhw&#257;ha sept of
R&#257;jp&#363;ts, but this is not at all probable.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Subdivisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste is divided into a number of subcastes, most
of which take their names from special plants which they grow. Thus the
Hardia K&#257;chhis grow <i>haldi</i> or turmeric; the Alias cultivate
the <i>&#257;l</i> or Indian madder, from which the well-known red dye
is obtained; the Ph&#363;lias are flower-gardeners; the Jirias take
their name from <i>jira</i> or cumin; the Murai or Murao K&#257;chhis
are called after the <i>muli</i> or radish; the Pirias <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>take
their name from the <i>piria</i> or basket in which they carry earth;
the Sanias grow <i>san</i> or hemp; the Mor K&#257;chhis are those who
prepare the <i>maur</i> or marriage-crown for weddings; and the
L&#299;lia subcaste are called after the indigo plant (<i>&#299;l</i>
or <i>n&#299;l</i>). In some localities they have a subcaste called
K&#257;chhw&#257;hi, who are considered to have a connection with the
R&#257;jp&#363;ts and to rank higher than the others.</p>

<div id="xd21e10020" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">3. Marriage customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The social customs of the K&#257;chhis resemble those
of the Kurmis. The descendants of the same parents do not intermarry
for three generations. A man may have two sisters to wife at the same
time. In the Damoh District, on the arrival of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
party, the bride is brought into the marriage-shed, and is there
stripped to the waist while she holds a leaf-cup in her hand; this is
probably done so that the bridegroom may see that the bride is free
from any bodily defect. Girls are usually married before they are ten
years old, and if the parents are too poor to arrange a match for their
daughter, the caste-fellows often raise a subscription when she attains
this age and get her married. The bridegroom should always be older
than the bride, and the difference is generally from five to ten years.
The bridegroom wears a loin-cloth and long coat reaching to the ground,
both of which are stained yellow with turmeric; the bride wears a red
cloth or one in which red is the main colour. The girl&rsquo;s father
gives her a dowry of a cow or jewels, or at least two rupees; while the
boy&rsquo;s father pays all the expenses of the wedding with the
exception of one feast. The bridegroom gives the bride a present of
three shoulder-cloths and three skirts, and one of these is worn by her
at the wedding; this is the old northern method of dress, but married
women do not usually adhere to it and have adopted the common
<i>s&#257;ri</i> or single body-cloth. The principal ceremony is the
<i>bh&#257;nwar</i> or walking round the sacred post. While the bride
and bridegroom are engaged in this the parents and elderly relatives
shut themselves into the house and weep. During the first four rounds
of the post the bride walks in front bowing her head and the bridegroom
places his right hand on her back; while during the last three the
bridegroom walks in front holding the bride by her third finger. After
this the bride is hidden somewhere in the house and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>bridegroom has to search for her. Sometimes the
bride&rsquo;s younger sister is dressed up in her clothes and the
bridegroom catches her in mistake for his wife, whereupon the old women
laugh and say to him, &lsquo;Do you want her also?&rsquo; If finally he
fails to find the bride he must give her some ornament.</p>
<p>After the wedding the bridegroom&rsquo;s marriage-crown is hung to
the roof in a basket. And on the sixth day of the following month of
Bh&#257;don (August), he again dresses himself in his wedding clothes,
and taking his marriage-crown on a dish, proceeds to the nearest stream
or river accompanied by his friends. Here he throws the crown into the
water, and the wedding coat is washed clean of the turmeric and unsewn
and made up into ordinary clothes. This ceremony is known as
<i>moschatt</i> and is common to Hindu castes generally. Widows are
permitted to marry again, and the most usual match is with the younger
brother of the deceased husband. Divorce is allowed at the instance
either of the husband or wife, and may be effected by a simple
declaration before the caste committee.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Childbirth.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After a birth neither the mother nor child are given
anything to eat the first day; and on the second they bring a young
calf and give a little of its urine to the child, and to the mother a
little sugar and the half of a cocoanut. In the evening of this day
they buy all kinds of hot spices and herbs from a Bania and make a cake
with them and give it to the mother to eat. On the second day the child
begins to drink its mother&rsquo;s milk. The navel-string is cut and
buried in the room on the first day, and over it a fire is kept burning
continuously during the period of impurity. The small piece which falls
from the child&rsquo;s body is buried beneath the mother&rsquo;s bed.
The period of impurity after the birth of a girl lasts for four days
and five days for a boy. On the sixth day the mother is given rice to
eat. Twelve days after a child is born the barber&rsquo;s wife cuts its
nails for the first time and throws the clippings away.</p>

members of the caste and may take food from <span class="corr" id=

pierced by a Sun&#257;r (goldsmith), who travels about the country in
the pursuit of this calling. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href=
"#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>A brass pin is left in the ear for
fifteen days, and is then removed and a strip of wood is substituted
for it in a boy&rsquo;s ear and a peacock&rsquo;s feather in that of a
girl to enlarge the hole. Girls do not have their nostrils pierced nor
wear nose-rings, as the K&#257;chhis are a comparatively low caste.
They are tattooed before or after marriage with patterns of a scorpion,
a peacock, a <i>discus</i>, and with dots on the chin and cheek-bones.
During the period of her monthly impurity a girl is secluded in the
house and does not eat flesh or fish. When the time is finished she
goes to the river and bathes and dresses her hair with earth, which is
a necessary ceremony of purification.</p>

<p class="first">The bodies of children under five and of persons dying
from smallpox, snake-bite or cholera are buried, and those of others
are cremated. In Chhindw&#257;ra they do not wash or anoint the corpses
of the dead, but sprinkle on them a little turmeric and water. On the
day of the funeral or cremation the bereaved family is supplied with
food by friends. The principal deity of the K&#257;chhis is
Bhains&#257;sur, who is regarded as the keeper of the vegetable garden
and is represented by a stone placed under a tree in any part of it. He
is worshipped once a year after the Holi festival with offerings of
vermilion, areca-nuts and cocoanuts, and libations of liquor. The
K&#257;chhis raise all kinds of vegetables and garden crops, the
principal being chillies, turmeric, tobacco, garlic, onions, yams and
other vegetables. They are diligent and laborious, and show much skill
in irrigating and manuring their crops.</p>

small occupational caste of makers of fireworks. The Kaderas numbered
2200 persons in 1911, and were most numerous in the Narsinghpur
District. They consider themselves to have come from Bundelkhand, where
the caste is also found, but it is in greatest strength in the
Gw&#257;lior State. In former times Kaderas were employed to
manufacture gunpowder and missiles of iron, and serve cannon in the
Indian armies. The term Goland&#257;z or &lsquo;ball-thrower&rsquo; was
also applied to native artillerymen. The B&#257;ndar or
&lsquo;rocket-throwers&rsquo; were a separate class, who fired rockets
containing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=

<i>v&#257;n</i>, an arrow. With them may be classed the Deg-and&#257;z

follows: &ldquo;The fire was never very rapid. Orme speaks of the
artillery firing once in a quarter of an hour. In 1721 the usual rate
of fire of heavy guns was once every three hours. Artillery which fired
once in two <i>gharis</i> or forty-four minutes was praised for its
rapidity of action. The guns were usually posted behind the clay walls
of houses; or they might take up a commanding position on the top of a
brick-kiln; or a temporary entrenchment might be formed out of the
earthen bank and ditch which usually surround a grove of
mango-trees.&rdquo; Haw&#257;id&#257;r is a term for a maker of
fireworks, while the name Kandera itself may perhaps be derived from
<i>kand</i>, an arrow.</p>

first claim to be R&#257;jp&#363;ts, but the alternative name of
D&#257;ngiw&#257;ra indicates that they are a mixed group, perhaps
partly of R&#257;jp&#363;t descent like the D&#257;ngis of Saugor. It
is by no means unlikely that the lower classes of R&#257;jp&#363;ts
should have been employed in the avocations of the Kaderas. The term
Dhunka signifies a cotton-cleaner, and some of the Kaderas may have
taken up this calling, when they could no longer find employment in the
native armies. Matw&#257;la means a drinker of country liquor, in which
members of this group indulge. But with the exception of the
R&#257;jp&#363;t Kaderas in Narsinghpur, other members of the caste
also drink it.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Social customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They celebrate their marriages by walking round the
sacred post. Divorce and the remarriage of widows are permitted. They
have a caste committee, with a headman called Chaudhri or Mehtar, and
an inferior officer known as Diw&#257;n. When a man has been put out of
caste the Chaudhri first takes food with him on readmission, and for
this is entitled to a fee of a rupee and a turban, while the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>Diw&#257;n receives a smaller cloth. These
offices are hereditary. The Kaderas have no <i>purda</i> system, and a
wife may speak freely to her father-in-law. They bury the milk-teeth of
children below the <i>ghinochi</i>, or stand for water-pots, with the
idea probably of preventing heat and inflammation in the gums. A
child&rsquo;s <i>jh&#257;la</i> or birth-hair is usually cut for the
first time on the occasion of some marriage in the family, and is
thrown into the Nerbudda or buried at a temple. Names are given by the
Br&#257;hman on the day of birth or soon afterwards, and a second pet
name is commonly used in the family. If a child sees a lamp on the
<i>chhati</i> or sixth day after its birth they think that it will
squint.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">4. Religion and occupation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste employ Br&#257;hmans for religious
ceremonies, but their social position is low, and they rank with castes
from whom a Br&#257;hman cannot take water. On the tenth day of Jeth
(May) they worship Lukm&#257;n Hak&#299;m, a personage whom they
believe to have been the inventor of gunpowder. He is popularly
identified with Solomon, and is revered with Muhammadan rites in the
shop and not in the house. A Fak&#299;r is called in who sacrifices a
goat, and makes an offering of the head, which becomes his perquisite;
sugar-cakes and sweet rice are also offered and given away to children,
and the flesh of the goat is eaten by the family of the worshipper.
Since the worship is paid only in the shop it would appear that
Lukm&#257;n Hak&#299;m is considered a deity foreign to the domestic
religion, and is revered as having invented the substance which enables
the caste to make their livelihood; and since he is clearly a
Muhammadan deity, and is venerated according to the ritual of this
religion by the Kaderas, who are otherwise Hindus, a recognition seems
to be implied that as far at least as the Kaderas are concerned the
introduction of gunpowder into India is attributed to the Muhammadans.
It is not stated whether or not the month of May was selected of set
purpose for the worship of the inventor of gunpowder, but it is at any
rate a most appropriate season in India. At present the Kadera makes
his own gunpowder and manufactures fireworks, and in this capacity he
is also known as Atashb&#257;z. The ingredients for gunpowder in
Narsinghpur are a pound of saltpetre, two ounces of sulphur, and four
ounces of charcoal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291"
name="pb291">291</a>]</span>of a light wood, such as
<i>s&#257;leh</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e10137src" href=

<i>arhar</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10144src" href="#xd21e10144"
name="xd21e10144src">4</a> Water is sprinkled on the charcoal and the
ingredients are pounded together in a mortar, a dangerous proceeding
which is apt to cause occasional vacancies in the family circle.
Arsenic and potash are also used for different fireworks, and sesamum
oil is added to prevent smoke. Fireworks form a very popular spectacle
in India, and can be obtained of excellent quality even in small towns.
Bharbh&#363;njas or grain-parchers now also deal in them.</p>

<b>Bhoi</b>.&mdash;The caste of palanquin-bearers and watermen of
northern India. No scientific distinction can be made between the
Kah&#257;rs and Dh&#299;mars, both names being applied to the same
people. In northern India the term Kah&#257;r is generally used, and
Mr. Crooke has an article on Kah&#257;r, but none on Dh&#299;mar. In
the Central Provinces the latter is the more common name for the caste,
and in 1911 23,000 Kah&#257;rs were returned as against nearly 300,000
Dh&#299;mars. Ber&#257;r had also 27,000 Kah&#257;rs. The social
customs of the caste are described in the article on Dh&#299;mar, but a
short separate notice is given to the Kah&#257;rs on account of their
special social interest. Some Kah&#257;rs refuse to clean household
cooking-vessels and hence occupy a slightly higher social position than
the Dh&#299;mars generally. Mr. Crooke derives the name of the caste
from the Sanskrit Skandha-k&#257;ra, or &lsquo;One who carries things
on his shoulder.&rsquo; The Br&#257;hmanical genealogists represent the
Kah&#257;r as descended from a Br&#257;hman father and a Chand&#257;l
or sweeper mother, and this is typical of the position occupied by the
caste, who, though probably derived from the primitive non-Aryan
tribes, have received a special position on account of their employment
as household servants, so that all classes may take water and cooked
food at their hands. As one of Mr. Crooke&rsquo;s correspondents
remarks: &ldquo;This caste is so low that they clean the vessels of
almost all castes except menials like the Cham&#257;r and Dhobi, and at
the same time so high that, except Kanaujia Br&#257;hmans, all other
castes eat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span><i>pakki</i> and drink water at their
hands.&rdquo; Sir D. Ibbetson says of the Kah&#257;r: &ldquo;He is a
true village menial, receiving customary dues and performing customary
service. His social standing is in one respect high; for all will drink
water at his hands. But he is still a servant, though the highest of
his class.&rdquo; This comparatively high degree of social purity
appears to have been conferred on the Kah&#257;rs and Dh&#299;mars from
motives of convenience, as it would be intolerable to have a
palanquin-bearer or indoor servant from whom one could not take a drink
of water.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. The <i>doli</i> or palanquin.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The proper occupation of the Kah&#257;r is that of
<i>doli</i> or litter-bearer. When carts could not travel owing to the
absence of roads this was the regular mode of conveyance of those who
could afford it and did not ride. Buchanan remarks: &ldquo;Few or none
except some chief native officers of Government keep bearers in
constant pay; but men of large estates give farms at low rents to their
bearers, who are ready at a call and receive food when
employed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10179src" href=
"#xd21e10179" name="xd21e10179src">2</a> A superior kind of litter used
by rich women had a domed roof supported on eight pillars with
side-boards like Venetian blinds; and was carried on two poles secured
to the sides beneath the roof. This is perhaps the progenitor of the
modern Calcutta <i>gh&#257;ri</i> or four-wheeler, just as the body of
the hansom-cab was modelled on the old sedan-chair. It was called
Kharkhariya in imitation of the rattling of the blinds when in
motion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10187src" href="#xd21e10187" name=
"xd21e10187src">3</a> The <i>p&#257;lki</i> or ordinary litter
consisted of a couch slung under a long bamboo, which formed an arch
over it. Over the arch was suspended a tilt made of cloth, which served
to screen the passenger from sun and rain. A third kind was the
Chaupala or square box open at the sides and slung on a bamboo; the
passenger sat doubled up inside this. If as was sometimes the case the
Chaupala was hung considerably beneath the bamboo the passenger was
miserably draggled by dust and mud. Nowadays regular litters are so
little used that they are not to be found in villages; but when
required because one cannot ride or for travelling at night they are
readily improvised by slinging a native wooden cot from two poles by
strings of bamboo-fibre. Most of the Kah&#257;rs and Dh&#299;mars have
forgotten how to carry a litter, and proceed very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>slowly with frequent stops to change shoulders
or substitute other bearers. But the Kols of Mandla still retain the
art, and will do more than four miles an hour for several hours if
eight men are allowed. Under native governments the privilege of riding
in a palanquin was a mark of distinction; and a rule was enforced that
no native could thus enter into the area of the forts in Madras and
Bombay without the permission of the Governor; such permission being
recorded in the order book at the gates of the fort and usually granted
only to a few who were lame or otherwise incapacitated. When General
Medows assumed the office of Governor of Bombay in 1788 some Parsis
waited on him and begged for the removal of this restriction; to which
the Governor replied, &ldquo;So long as you do not force me to ride in
this machine he may who likes it&rdquo;; and so the rule was
abrogated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10198src" href="#xd21e10198"
name="xd21e10198src">4</a> A passage from Hobson-Jobson, however, shows
that the Portuguese were much stricter in this respect: &ldquo;In 1591
a proclamation of the Viceroy, Matthias d&rsquo;Albuquerque, ordered:
&lsquo;That no person of what quality or condition soever, shall go in
a <i>palanquy</i> without my express licence, save they be over sixty
years of age, to be first proved before the Auditor-General of Police
... and those who contravene this shall pay a penalty of 200 cruzados,
and persons of mean estate the half, the <i>palanquys</i> and their
belongings to be forfeited, and the <i>bois</i> or <i>mou&ccedil;os</i>
who carry such <i>palanquys</i> shall be condemned to His
Majesty&rsquo;s galleys.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10220src" href="#xd21e10220" name="xd21e10220src">5</a> The
meaning of the last sentence appears to be that the bearers were
considered as slaves, and were forfeited to the king&rsquo;s service as
a punishment to their owner. As the unauthorised use of this conveyance
was so severely punished it would appear that riding in a palanquin
must have been a privilege of nobility. Similarly to ride on a horse
was looked upon in something of the same light; and when a person of
inferior consequence met a superior or a Government officer while
riding, he had to dismount from his horse as a mark of respect until
the other had passed. This last custom still obtains to some extent,
though it is rapidly disappearing.</p>
<p>As a means of conveyance the litter would be held sacred
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>by primitive people, and Mr. Crooke gives an
instance of the regard paid to it: &ldquo;At the Holi festival eight
days before Diw&#257;li in the western Districts the house is plastered
with cowdung and figures of a litter (<i>doli</i>) and bearers are made
on the walls with four or five colours, and to them offerings of
incense, lights and flowers are given.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10236src" href="#xd21e10236" name="xd21e10236src">6</a> Even
after passable roads were made tongas or carts drawn by
trotting-bullocks were slow in coming into general use owing to the
objection felt by the Hindus to harnessing the sacred ox.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At royal courts women were employed to carry the
litters of the king and the royal ladies into the inner precincts of
the palace, the male bearers relinquishing their charge outside.
&ldquo;Another class of attendants at the palace peculiar to Lucknow
were the female bearers. Their occupation was to carry the palanquins
and various covered conveyances of the king and his ladies into the
inner courts of the harem. These female bearers were also under
military discipline. They had their officers, commissioned and
non-commissioned. The head of them, a great masculine woman of pleasing
countenance, was an especial favourite of the king. The <i>badinage</i>
which was exchanged between them was of the freest possible
character&mdash;not fit for ears polite, of course; but the
extraordinary point in it was that no one hearing it or witnessing such
scenes could have supposed it possible that a king and a slave stood
before him as the two chief disputants.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">4. Indoor servants.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From being a palanquin-bearer the Kah&#257;r became
the regular indoor servant of Hindu households. Originally of low
caste, and derived from the non-Aryan tribes, they did not object to
eat the leavings of food of their masters, a relation which is
naturally very convenient, if not essential, in poor Hindu houses. Sir
H. Risley notes, however, that in Bengal a Kah&#257;r engaged in
personal service with a Br&#257;hman, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>R&#257;jp&#363;t,
B&#257;bhan, K&#257;yasth or Agarw&#257;l, will only eat his
master&rsquo;s leavings so long as he is himself unmarried.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10272src" href="#xd21e10272" name=
"xd21e10272src">10</a> It seems that the marriage feast may be
considered as the sacrificial meal conferring full membership of the
caste, after which the rules against taking food from other castes must
be strictly observed. Slaves were commonly employed as indoor servants,
and hence the term Kah&#257;r came to be almost synonymous with a
slave. &ldquo;In the eighteenth century the title Kah&#257;r was at
Patna the distinctive appellation of a Hindu slave, as Maulaz&#257;dah
was of a Muhammadan, and the tradition in 1774 was that the Kah&#257;r
slavery took its rise when the Muhammadans first invaded northern
India.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10277src" href="#xd21e10277"
name="xd21e10277src">11</a></p>
<p>As the Kah&#257;r was the common indoor servant in Hindu houses so
apparently he came to be employed in the same capacity by the English.
But he was of too high a caste to serve the food of a European, which
would have involved touching the cooked flesh of the cow, and thus lost
him his comparatively good status and social purity among the Hindus.
Hence arose the anomaly of a body servant who would not touch his
master&rsquo;s food, and confined himself to the duties of a valet;
while the name of bearer given to this servant indicates clearly that
he is the successor of the old-time Kah&#257;r or palanquin-bearer. The
Uriya bearers of Bengal were well known as excellent servants and most
faithful; but in time the inconvenience of their refusal to wait at
table has led to their being replaced by low-caste Madrasis and by
Muhammadans. The word &lsquo;boy&rsquo; as applied to Indian servants
is no doubt of English origin, as it is also used in China and the West
Indies; but the South Indian term <i>boyi</i> or Hindi <i>bhoi</i> for
a palanquin-bearer also appears to have been corrupted into boy and to
have made this designation more common. The following instances of the
use of the word &lsquo;boy&rsquo; from <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e10289" title=
"Source: Hobson-Johnson">Hobson-Jobson</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10291src" href="#xd21e10291" name="xd21e10291src">12</a> may be
quoted in conclusion: &ldquo;The real Indian ladies lie on a sofa, and
if they drop their handkerchief they just lower their voices and say
&lsquo;Boy,&rsquo; in a very gentle tone&rdquo; (<i>Letters from
Madras</i> in 1826). &lsquo;Yes, S&#257;hib, I Christian Boy. Plenty
poojah do. Sunday time never no work do&rsquo; (Trevelyan, <i>The Dawk
Bungalow</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>in 1866). The Hindu term Bhoi or bearer is now
commonly applied to the Gonds, and is considered by them as an
honorific name or title. The hypothesis thus appears to be confirmed
that the Kah&#257;r caste of palanquin-bearers was constituted from the
non-Aryan tribes, who were practically in the position of slaves to the
Hindus, as were the Cham&#257;rs and Mah&#257;rs, the village drudges
and labourers. But when the palanquin-bearer developed into an indoor
servant, his social status was gradually raised from motives of
convenience, until he grew to be considered as ceremonially pure, and
able to give his master water and prepare food for cooking. Thus the
Kah&#257;rs or Dh&#299;mars came to rank considerably above the
primitive tribes from whom they took their origin, their ceremonial
purity being equal to that of the Hindu cultivating castes, while the
degrading status of slavery which had at first attached to them
gradually fell into abeyance. And thus one can understand why the Gonds
should consider the name of Bhoi or bearer as a designation of
honour.</p>

2000 persons in the Central Provinces. The Kaik&#257;ris here, as
elsewhere, claim to have come from Teling&#257;na or the Deccan, but
there is no caste of this name in the Madras Presidency. They may not
improbably be the caste there known as Korva or Yer&#363;kala, whose
occupations are similar. Mr. Kitts<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10324src"

hand, and <i>kude</i>, basket, and if this is correct it is in favour
of their identification with the Korvas, who always carry their
tattooing and other implements in a basket in the hand.<a class=

ancestor was one K&#257;noba Ramj&#257;n who handed a twig to his sons
and told them to earn their livelihood by it. Since then they have
subsisted by making baskets from the stalks of the cotton-plant, the
leaves of the date-palm and grass. They themselves derive their name
from <i>Kai</i>, standing for K&#257;noba Ramj&#257;n and

are the remnants of the Kaikeyas, who before the Christian era dwelt
north of the Jalandhar Do&#257;b. Two subcastes exist in Nim&#257;r,
the Mar&#257;thas and the Phirasti or wandering Kaik&#257;ris, the
former no doubt representing recruits from Mar&#257;tha castes, not
improbably from the Kunbis. The Mar&#257;tha Kaik&#257;ris look down on
the Phirastis as the latter take cooked food from a number of castes
including the Telis, while the Mar&#257;thas refuse to do this. In the
N&#257;gpur country there are several divisions which profess to be
endogamous, as the K&#257;m&#257;this or those selling toys made of
palm-leaves, the Bh&#257;mtis or those who steal from baz&#257;rs, the
Kunbis or cultivators, the Tokriw&#257;las or makers and sellers of
baskets and the Boriw&#257;las or those who carry bricks, gravel and
stone. Kunbi and Bh&#257;mti are the names of other castes, and
K&#257;m&#257;thi is a general term applied in the Mar&#257;tha country
to Telugu immigrants; the names thus show that the Kaik&#257;ris, like
other vagrant groups, are largely recruited from persons expelled from
their own caste for social offences. These groups cannot really be
endogamous as yet, but as in the case of several other wandering tribes
they probably have a tendency to become so. In Ber&#257;r<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10360src" href="#xd21e10360" name=

is recorded, several of which are territorial, and two, the Pungis or
blowers of gourds, and the W&#257;jantris or village musicians, are
occupational. In Nim&#257;r as in Kh&#257;ndesh<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10364src" href="#xd21e10364" name="xd21e10364src">7</a> the
Kaik&#257;ris have only two exogamous clans, J&#257;don and
Gaikw&#257;r, who must marry with each other. In the southern Districts
there are a number of exogamous divisions, as J&#257;don, M&#257;ne,
K&#363;mre, Jeshti, K&#257;de, D&#257;ne and others. J&#257;don is a
well-known R&#257;jp&#363;t sept, and the Kaik&#257;ris do not explain
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=

fought as soldiers under several kings, during which occasions the name
may have been adopted from some R&#257;jp&#363;t leader in accordance
with the common practice of imitation. M&#257;ne and Gaikw&#257;r are
family names of the Mar&#257;tha caste. The names and varied
nomenclature of the subdivisions show that the Kaik&#257;ris, as at
present constituted, are a very mixed caste, though they may not
improbably have been originally connected with the Korvas of
Madras.</p>

ceremonies of a regular marriage being gone through. The tree is
subsequently carefully reared, or the ring worn on the finger. Should
the tree die or the ring be lost, funeral obsequies are performed for
it as for a member of the family. A bride-price is paid which may vary
from Rs. 20 to Rs. 100. In the southern Districts the following custom
is in vogue at weddings. After the ceremony the bridegroom pretends to
be angry and goes out of the <i>mandap</i> or shed, on which the bride
runs after him, and throwing a piece of cloth round his neck, drags him
back again. Her father then gives him some money or ornaments to pacify
him. After this the same performance is gone through with the bride.
The bride is taken to her husband&rsquo;s house, but is soon brought
back by her relatives. On her second departure the husband himself does
not go to fetch her, and she is brought home by his father and other
relations, her own family presenting her with new clothes on this
occasion. Widow-marriage is permitted, and the widow is expected to
marry the next younger brother of the deceased husband. She may not
marry any except the next younger, and if <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb299" href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>another should take
her he is expelled from the caste until the connection is severed. If
she marries somebody else he must repay to her late husband&rsquo;s
brother a half of the expenses incurred on the first marriage. In the
southern Districts she may not marry a brother of her husband&rsquo;s
at all. A widow cannot be married in her late husband&rsquo;s house,
but is taken to her parents&rsquo; house and married from there. In
Nim&#257;r her family do not take anything, but in the south they are
paid a small sum. Here also the marriage is performed at the second
husband&rsquo;s house; the woman carries to it a new earthen pitcher
filled with water, and, placing it on the <i>chauk</i> or pattern of
lines traced with flour in the courtyard, touches the feet of the Panch
or caste committee, after which her skirt is tied to her
husband&rsquo;s cloth. The pair are seated on a blanket and new bangles
are placed on the woman&rsquo;s wrist, widows officiating at the
ceremony. The couple then leave the village and pass the night outside
it, returning next morning, when the woman manages to enter the house
without being perceived by a married woman or unmarried girl. A
bachelor marrying a widow must first go through the ceremony with a
ring or <i>akao</i> plant, as already described, this being his real
marriage; if he omits the rite his daughters by the widow will not be
considered as members of the caste, though his sons will be admitted.
Polygamy is allowed, but the consent of the first wife must be obtained
to the taking of a second, and she may require a written promise of
good treatment after the second marriage. A second wife is usually only
taken if the first is barren, and if she has children her parents
usually interfere to dissuade the husband, while other parents are
always averse to giving their daughter in marriage to a man under such
circumstances. Divorce is permitted for the usual reasons, a deed being
drawn up and attested by the <i>panch&#257;yat</i>, to whom the husband
pays a fine of Rs. 8 or Rs. 10.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tutelary god of the Kaik&#257;ris is the
<i>N&#257;g</i> or cobra, who is worshipped at marriages and on the day
of N&#257;g-Panchmi. Every family has in the house a platform dedicated
to Khandoba, the Mar&#257;tha god of war. They also worship
Mar&#299;m&#257;ta, to whom flowers are offered at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>festivals, and a little <i>gh&#299;</i> is
poured out in her honour by way of incense. When the ju&#257;ri harvest
is gathered, <i>dalias</i> or cakes of boiled ju&#257;ri and a ewe are
offered to Mar&#299;m&#257;ta. They do not revere the Hindu sacred
trees, the p&#299;pal and banyan, nor the basil plant, and will readily
cut them down. They both burn and bury the dead. The J&#257;dons burn
all married persons, but if they cannot afford firewood they touch the
corpse with a burning cinder and then bury it. The Gaikw&#257;rs always
bury their dead, the corpse being laid naked on its back with the feet
pointing to the south. On returning from the burial-ground each
relative of the deceased gives one <i>roti</i> or wheaten cake to the
bereaved family, and they eat, sharing the cakes with the
<i>panch&#257;yat</i>. Bread is also presented on the second day, and
on the third the family begin to cook again. Mourning lasts for ten
days, and on the last day the house is cleaned and the earthen pots
thrown out; the clothes of the family are washed and the males are
shaved. Ten balls of rice cooked in milk are offered to the soul of the
dead person and a feast is given to the caste. After a birth the mother
remains impure for five weeks. For the first five days both the mother
and child are bathed daily. The navel cord and after-birth are buried
by the midwife in a rubbish heap. When the milk teeth fall out they are
placed in a ball of the dung of an ass and thrown on to the roof of the
house. It is considered that the rats or mice, who have very good and
sharp teeth, will take them and give the child good teeth in exchange.
Women are impure for five days during the menstrual period. When a girl
attains maturity a ceremony called <i>god-bharni</i> is performed. The
neighbours are invited and songs are sung and the girl is seated in the
<i>chauk</i> or pattern of lines traced with flour. She is given new
clothes and bangles by her father, or her father-in-law if she is
married, and rice and plantains, cocoanuts and other fruits are tied up
in her skirt. This is no doubt done so that the girl may in like manner
be fruitful, the cocoanuts perhaps being meant to represent human
heads, as they usually do.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Social customs and position.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kaik&#257;ris eat flesh, including pork and fowls,
but not beef. In Nim&#257;r the animals which they eat must have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>their throats cut by a Muhammadan with the
proper formula, otherwise it is considered as murder to slaughter them.
Both men and women drink liquor. They take food cooked with water from
Kunbis and M&#257;lis and take water from the same castes, but not from
Dh&#299;mars, Nais or Kah&#257;rs. No caste will take food from a
Kaik&#257;ri. Their touch is considered to defile a Br&#257;hman,
Bania, Kal&#257;r and other castes, but not a Kunbi. They are not
allowed to enter temples but may live inside the village. Their status
is thus very low. They have a caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee,
and punishments are imposed for the usual offences. Permanent exclusion
from caste is rarely or never inflicted, and even a woman who has gone
wrong with an outsider may be readmitted after a peculiar ceremony of
purification. The delinquent is taken to a river, tank or well, and is
there shaved clean. Her tongue is branded with a ring or other article
of gold, and she is then seated under a wooden shed having two doors.
She goes in by one door and sits in the shed, which is set on fire. She
must remain seated until the whole shed is burning and is then allowed
to escape by the other door. A young boy of the caste is finally asked
to eat from her hand, and thus purified she is readmitted to social
intercourse. Fire is the great purifier, and this ceremony probably
symbolises the immolation of the delinquent and her new birth. A
similar ordeal is practised among the Korvas of Bombay, and this fact
may be taken as affording further evidence of the identity of the two
castes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10441src" href="#xd21e10441" name=
"xd21e10441src">8</a> The morals of the caste are, however, by no means
good, and some of them are said to live by prostituting their women.
The dog is held especially sacred as with all worshippers of Khandoba,
and to swear by a dog is Khandoba&rsquo;s oath and is considered the
most binding. The Kaik&#257;ris are of dark colour and have repulsive
features. They do not bathe or change their clothes for days together.
They are also quarrelsome, and in Bombay the word Kaik&#257;rin is a
proverbial term for a dirty shrew. Women are profusely tattooed,
because tattooing is considered to be a record of the virtuous acts
performed in this world and must be displayed to the deity after death.
If no marks <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=

and punished for having acquired no piety.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Basket-making is the traditional occupation of the
Kaik&#257;ris and is still followed by them. They do not however make
baskets from bamboos, but from cotton-stalks, palm-leaves and grass. In
the south they are principally employed as carriers of stone, lime,
bricks and gravel. Like most wandering castes they have a bad
character. In Ber&#257;r the R&#257;n Kaik&#257;ris are said to be the
most criminal class.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10453src" href=
"#xd21e10453" name="xd21e10453src">9</a> They act under a chief who is
elected for life, and wander about in the cold weather, usually
carrying their property on donkeys. Their ostensible occupations are to
make baskets and mend grinding mills. A notice of them in
Lawrence&rsquo;s <i>Settlement Report</i> of Bhand&#257;ra (1867)
stated that they were then professional thieves, openly avowing their
dependence on predatory occupations for subsistence, and being
particularly dexterous at digging through the walls of houses and
secret pilfering.</p>

<h3 class="main">1. Origin.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Kalanga.</b>&mdash;A cultivating caste of
Chhatt&#299;sgarh numbering 1800 persons in 1911. In Sambalpur they
live principally in the Phuljhar zam&#299;nd&#257;ri on the border,
between Chhatt&#299;sgarh and the Uriya track. The Kalangas appear to
be a Dravidian tribe who took up military service and therefore adopted
a territorial name, Kalanga being probably derived from Kalinga, the
name of the sea-board of the Telugu country. The Kalangas may be a
branch of the great Kalingi tribe of Madras. They have mixed much with
the Kawars, and in Phuljhar say that they have three branches, the
Kalingia, Kawar and Chero Kalangas; Kawar and Chero are names for the
same tribe, and the last two branches are thus probably a mixture of
Kalingis and Kawars, while the first comprises the original Kalingis.
The Kalangas themselves, like the Kawars, say that they are the
descendants of the Kauravas of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, and that they
came from northern India with the R&#257;jas of Patna, whom they still
serve. But their features indicate their Dravidian descent as also
their social customs, especially that of killing a cock with the bare
hands on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>the birth of a child, and anointing the
infant&rsquo;s forehead with its blood. They have not retained their
Telugu language, however, and like the Kawars now speak a dialect of
Chhatt&#299;sgarhi at home, while many also know Uriya.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">2. Subdivisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kalangas have no real endogamous divisions but a
large number of exogamous groups or <i>bargas</i>, the names of which
are derived from animals, plants, or material objects, nicknames,
occupations or titles. Instances of the totemistic groups are Barha the
wild boar, Magar the crocodile, Bichhi the scorpion, Saria a variety of
rice, Chhati a mushroom, Khumri a leaf umbrella, and several others.
The members of the group revere the animal, plant or other object from
which it takes its name and would refuse to injure it or use it for
food. They salute the object whenever they see it. Instances of other
group names are M&#257;njhi a headman, Behra a cook, Gunda dusty,
Kap&#257;t a shutter, Bhundi a hole, Ch&#299;ka muddy, Bh&#299;l a
tribe, Rendia quarrelsome, and Bersia a Thug or strangler. Some of the
nicknames or titles are curious, as for instance Kap&#257;t, a shutter,
which stands for gate-keeper, and Bhundi, a hole, which indicates a
defective person. Some of the group names are those of other castes,
and this probably indicates the admission of families of other castes
among the Kalangas. One of the groups is called Kusundi, the meaning of
which is not known, but whenever any one of the caste gets maggots in a
wound and is temporarily expelled, it is a member of the Kusundi group,
if one is available, who gives him water on his readmission into caste.
This is a dangerous service, because it renders the performer liable to
the burden of the other&rsquo;s sin, and when no Kusundi is present
five or seven men of other groups combine in doing it so as to reduce
the risk to a fraction. But why this function of a scapegoat should be
imposed upon the Kusundi group, or whether it possesses any peculiar
sanctity which protects it from danger, cannot be explained.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage within the same <i>barga</i> or group is
prohibited and also the union of first cousins. Marriage is usually
adult and matches are arranged between the parents of the parties. A
considerable quantity of grain with five pieces of cloth and Rs. 5 are
given to the father of the bride. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb304" href="#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span>marriage-shed is
erected and a post of the mahua tree fixed inside it. Three days before
the wedding a G&#257;nda goes to the shed with some pomp and worships
the village gods there. In the ceremony the bridegroom and bride
proceed separately seven times round the post, this rite being
performed for three days running. During the four days of the wedding
the fathers of the bride and bridegroom each give one meal to the whole
caste on two days, while the other meal on all four days is given to
the wedding party by the members of the caste resident in the village.
This may be a survival of the time when all members of the village
community were held to be related. Widow-marriage is allowed, but the
widow must obtain the consent of the caste people before taking a
second husband, and a feast must be given to them. If the widow has no
children and there are no relatives to succeed to her late
husband&rsquo;s property, it is expended on feeding the caste people.
Divorce is permitted and is effected by breaking the woman&rsquo;s
bangles in front of the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i>. In memory perhaps
of their former military profession the Kalangas worship the sword on
the 15th day of Shr&#257;wan and the 9th day of Kunw&#257;r. Offerings
are made to the dead in the latter month, but not to persons who have
died a violent death. The spirits of these must be laid lest they
should trouble the living, and this is done in the following manner: a
handful of rice is placed at the threshold of the house, and a ring is
suspended by <span class="corr" id="xd21e10494" title=
"Source: at hread">a thread</span> so as to touch the rice. A goat is
then brought up, and when it eats the rice, the spirit of the dead
person is considered to have entered into the goat, which is thereupon
killed and eaten by the family so as to dispose of him once for all. If
the goat will not eat the rice it is made to do so. The spirit of a man
who has been killed by a tiger must, however, be laid by the Sulia or
sorcerer of the caste, who goes through the formula of pretending to be
a tiger and of mauling another sorcerer.</p>

<i>katchi</i> food from nobody. Only the lowest castes will take food
from them. They drink liquor and eat fowls and rats, but not beef or
pork. A man who gets his ear torn is temporarily excluded from caste,
and this penalty is also imposed for the other usual offences. A woman
committing adultery with a man of another caste is permanently
expelled. The Kalangas are somewhat tall in stature. Their features are
Dravidian, and in their dress and ornaments they follow the
Chhatt&#299;sgarhi style. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href=

"xd21e10610src" href="#xd21e10610" name="xd21e10610src">3</a> flowers;
the price afterwards falling heavily. Agru sold his stock at a discount
and cut the loss; but Seoru, unwilling to suffer it, distilled liquor
from his flowers and sold the liquor, thus recouping himself for his
expenditure. But in consequence of his action he was degraded from the
Bania caste and his descendants became Kal&#257;rs. The Jaisw&#257;r,
Kanaujia and Seoh&#257;re divisions are also found in northern India,
and the By&#257;hut both there and in Bengal. Mr. Crooke states that
the caste may be an offshoot from the Bania or other Vaishya tribes;
and a slight physical resemblance may perhaps be traced between
Kal&#257;rs and Banias. It may be noticed also that some of the
Kal&#257;rs are Jains, a religion to which scarcely any others except
Banias adhere. Another hypothesis, however, is that since the
Kal&#257;rs have become prosperous and wealthy they devised a story
connecting them with the Bania caste in order to improve their social
position.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Chhatt&#299;sgarh the principal division of the
Kal&#257;rs is that of the Dandsenas or &lsquo;Stick-carriers,&rsquo;
and in explanation of the name they relate the following story:
&ldquo;A Kal&#257;r boy was formerly the Mah&#257;pras&#257;d or bosom
friend of the son of the R&#257;jp&#363;t king of Balod.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10620src" href="#xd21e10620" name=
"xd21e10620src">4</a> But the R&#257;ja&rsquo;s son fell in love with
the Kal&#257;r boy&rsquo;s sister and entertained evil intentions
towards her. Then the Kal&#257;r boy went and complained to the
R&#257;ja, who was his Ph&#363;lb&#257;ba,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10623src" href="#xd21e10623" name="xd21e10623src">5</a> the
father of his friend, saying, &lsquo;A dog is always coming into my
house and defiling it, what am I to do?&rsquo; The R&#257;ja replied
that he must kill the dog. Then the boy asked whether he would be
punished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>for killing him, and the R&#257;ja said, No. So
the next day as the R&#257;jp&#363;t boy was entering his house to get
at his sister, the Kal&#257;r boy killed him, though he was his dearest
friend. Then the R&#257;jp&#363;ts attacked the Kal&#257;rs, but they
were led only by the queen, as the king had said that the Kal&#257;r
boy might kill the dog. But the R&#257;jp&#363;ts were being defeated
and so the R&#257;ja intervened, and the Kal&#257;rs then ceased
fighting as the R&#257;ja had broken his word. But they left Balod,
saying that they would drink no more of its waters, which they have not
done to this day.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10628src" href=

<h3 class="main">4. Social customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The marriage customs of the caste follow the ordinary
Hindu ritual prevalent in the locality and are not of special interest.
Before a Kal&#257;r wedding procession starts a ceremony known as
marrying the well is performed. The mother or aunt of the bridegroom
goes to the well and sits in the mouth with her legs hanging down
inside it and asks what the bridegroom will give her. He then goes
round the well seven times, and a stick of <i>k&#257;ns</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10641src" href="#xd21e10641" name=
"xd21e10641src">7</a> grass is thrown into it at each turn. Afterwards
he promises the woman some handsome present and she returns to the
house. Another explanation of the story is that the woman pretends to
be overcome with grief at the bridegroom&rsquo;s departure and
threatens to throw herself into the well unless he will give her
something. The well-to-do marry their daughters at an early age, but no
stigma attaches to those who have to postpone the ceremony. A
bride-price is not customary, but if the girl&rsquo;s parents are poor
they sometimes receive help from those of the boy in order to carry out
the wedding. Matches are usually arranged at the caste feasts, and a
Br&#257;hman officiates at the ceremony. Divorce is recognised and
widows are allowed to marry again except by the By&#257;hut subcaste.
The Kal&#257;rs worship the ordinary Hindu deities, and those who sell
liquor revere an earthen jar filled with wine at the Holi festival. The
educated are usually Vaishnavas by sect, and as already stated a few of
them belong to the Jain religion. The social status of the Kal&#257;rs
is equivalent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>to that of the village menials, ranking below
the good cultivating castes. Br&#257;hmans do not take water from their
hands. But in Mandla, where the Kal&#257;rs are important and
prosperous, certain Sarwaria Br&#257;hmans who were their household
priests took water from them, thus recognising them as socially pure.
This has led to a split among the local Sarwaria Br&#257;hmans, the
families who did not take water from the Kal&#257;rs refusing to
intermarry with those who did so.</p>
<p>While the highest castes of Hindus eschew spirituous liquor the
cultivating and middle classes are divided, some drinking it and others
not; and to the menial and labouring classes, and especially to the
forest tribes, it is the principal luxury of their lives. Unfortunately
they have not learnt to indulge in moderation and nearly always drink
to excess if they have the means, while the intoxicating effect of even
a moderate quantity is quickly perceptible in their behaviour.</p>
<p>In the Central Provinces the liquor drunk is nearly all distilled
from the flowers of the mahua tree (<i>Bassia latifolia</i>), though
elsewhere it is often made from cane sugar. The smell of the fermented
mahua and the refuse water lying about make the village liquor-shop an
unattractive place. But the trade has greatly profited the Kal&#257;rs
by the influence which it has given them over the lower classes.
&ldquo;With the control of the liquor-supply in their hands,&rdquo; Mr.
Montgomerie writes, &ldquo;they also controlled the Gonds, and have
played a more important part in the past history of the Chhindw&#257;ra
District than their numbers would indicate.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e10654src" href="#xd21e10654" name="xd21e10654src">8</a> The
Kal&#257;r and Teli (oil-presser) are usually about on the same
standing; they are the creditors of the poorer tenants and labourers,
as the Bania is of the landowners and substantial cultivators. These
two of the village trades are not suited to the method of payment by
annual contributions of grain, and must from an early period have been
conducted by single transactions of barter. Hence the Kal&#257;r and
Teli learnt to keep accounts and to appreciate the importance of the
margin of profit. This knowledge and the system of dealing on credit
with the exaction of interest have stood <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>them in good stead
and they have prospered at the expense of their fellow-villagers. The
Kal&#257;rs have acquired substantial property in several Districts,
especially in those mainly populated by Gonds, as Mandla, Bet&#363;l
and Chhindw&#257;ra. In British Districts of the Central Provinces they
own 750 villages, or about 4 per cent of the total. In former times
when salt was highly taxed and expensive the Gonds had no salt. The
Kal&#257;rs imported rock-salt and sold it to the Gonds in large
pieces. These were hung up in the Gond houses just as they are in
stables, and after a meal every one would go up to the lump of salt and
lick it as ponies do. When the Gonds began to wear cloth instead of
leaves and beads the Kal&#257;rs retailed them thin strips of cloth
just sufficient for decency, and for the cloth and salt a large
proportion of the Gond&rsquo;s harvest went to the Kal&#257;r. When a
Gond has threshed his grain the Kal&#257;r takes round liquor to the
threshing-floor and receives a present of grain much in excess of its
value. Thus the Gond has sold his birthright for a mess of pottage and
the Kal&#257;r has taken his heritage. Only a small proportion of the
caste are still supported by the liquor traffic, and a third of the
whole are agriculturists. Others have engaged in the timber trade,
purchasing teak timber from the Gonds in exchange for liquor, a form of
commerce which has naturally redounded to their great advantage. A few
are educated and have risen to good positions in Government service.
Sir D. Ibbetson describes them as &lsquo;Notorious for enterprise,
energy and obstinacy. Death may budge, but a Kal&#257;r
won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; The Sikh Kal&#257;rs, who usually call themselves
Ahluw&#257;lia, contain many men who have attained to high positions
under Government, especially as soldiers, and the general testimony is
that they make brave soldiers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10661src"
href="#xd21e10661" name="xd21e10661src">9</a> One of the ruling chiefs
of the Punjab belongs to this caste. Until quite recently the
manufacture of liquor, except in the large towns, was conducted in
small pot-stills, of which there was one for a circle of perhaps two
dozen villages with subordinate shops. The right of manufacture and
vend in each separate one of these stills was sold annually by auction
at the District headquarters, and the Kal&#257;rs assembled to bid for
it. And here instances of their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311"
href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>dogged perseverance could
often be noticed; when a man would bid up for a licence to a sum far in
excess of the profits which he could hope to acquire from it, rather
than allow himself to be deprived of a still which he desired to
retain.</p>

<h3 class="main">5. Liquor held divine in Vedic times.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though alcoholic liquor is now eschewed by the higher
castes of Hindus and forbidden by their religion, this has by no means
always been the case. In Vedic times the liquor known as Soma was held
in so much esteem by the Aryans that it was deified and worshipped as
one of their principal gods. Dr. Hopkins summarises<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e10674src" href="#xd21e10674" name="xd21e10674src">10</a> the
attributes of the divine wine, Soma, as follows, from passages in the
Rig-Veda: &ldquo;This offering of the juice of the Soma-plant in India
was performed thrice daily. It is said in the Rig-Veda that Soma grows
upon the mountain M&#363;jawat, that its or his father is Parjanya, the
rain-god, and that the waters are his sisters. From this mountain, or
from the sky, accounts differ, Soma was brought by a hawk. He is
himself represented in other places as a bird; and as a divinity he
shares in the praise given to Indra. It was he who helped Indra to slay
Vritra, the demon that keeps back the rain. Indra, intoxicated by Soma,
does his great deeds, and indeed all the gods depend on Soma for
immortality. Divine, a weapon-bearing god, he often simply takes the
place of Indra and other gods in Vedic eulogy. It is the god Soma
himself who slays Vritra, Soma who overthrows cities, Soma who begets
the gods, creates the sun, upholds the sky, prolongs life, sees all
things, and is the one best friend of god and man, the divine drop
(<i>&#299;ndu</i>), the friend of Indra. As a god he is associated not
only with Indra but also with Agni, Rudra and Push&#257;n. A few
passages in the later portion of the Rig-Veda show that Soma already
was identified with the moon before the end of this period. After this
the lunar yellow god was regularly regarded as the visible and divine
Soma of heaven represented on earth by the plant.&rdquo; Mr. Hopkins
discards the view advanced by some commentators that it is the moon and
not the beverage to which the Vedic hymns and worship are addressed,
and there is no reason to doubt that he is right. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>soma</i> plant has been thought to be the <i>Asclepias
acida</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10691src" href="#xd21e10691"
name="xd21e10691src">11</a> a plant growing in Persia and called
<i>hom</i> in Persian. The early Persians believed that the <i>hom</i>
plant gave great energy to body and mind.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10704src" href="#xd21e10704" name="xd21e10704src">12</a> An angel
is believed to preside over the plant, and the Hom Yast is devoted to
its praises. Twigs of it are beaten in water in the smaller
<i>Agiari</i> or fire-temple, and this water is considered sacred, and
is given to newborn children to drink.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10715src" href="#xd21e10715" name="xd21e10715src">13</a> Dr.
Hopkins states, however, that the <i>hom</i> or <i>Asclepias acida</i>
was not the original <i>soma</i>, as it does not grow in the Punjab
region, but must have been a later substitute. Afterwards again another
kind of liquor, <i>sura</i>, became the popular drink, and <i>soma</i>,
which was now not so agreeable, was reserved as the priests&rsquo;
(gods&rsquo;) drink, a sacrosanct beverage not for the vulgar, and not
esteemed by the priests except as it kept up the rite.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10736src" href="#xd21e10736" name=

<p><i>Soma</i> is said to have been prepared from the juice of the
creeper already mentioned, which was diluted with water, mixed with
barley meal, clarified butter and the flour of wild rice, and fermented
in a jar for nine days.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10746src" href=

<h3 class="main">6. Subsequent prohibition of alcohol.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though in the cold regions of Central Asia the
cheering and warming liquor had been held divine, in the hot plains of
India the evil effects of alcohol were apparently soon realised.
&ldquo;Even more bold is the scorn of the gods in Hymn x. 119 of the
Rig-Veda, which introduces Indra in his merriest humour, ready to give
away everything, ready to destroy the earth and all that it contains,
boasting of his greatness in ridiculous fashion&mdash;all this because,
as the refrain tells us, he is in an advanced state of intoxication
caused by excessive appreciation of the <i>soma</i> offered to him.
Another Hymn (vii. 103) sings of the frogs, comparing their voices to
the noise of a Br&#257;hmanical school and their hopping round the tank
to the behaviour of drunken priests celebrating a nocturnal offering of
<i>soma</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10766src" href=
"#xd21e10766" name="xd21e10766src">16</a> It seems clear, therefore,
that the evil effects of drunkenness were early realised, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>and
led to a religious prohibition of alcohol. Dr. R&#257;jendra L&#257;l
Mitra writes:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10774src" href="#xd21e10774"
name="xd21e10774src">17</a> &ldquo;But the fact remains unquestioned
that from an early period the Hindus have denounced in their sacred
writings the use of wine as sinful, and two of their greatest
law-givers, Manu and Yajnavalkya, held that the only expiation meet for
a Br&#257;hman who had polluted himself by drinking spirit was suicide
by a draught of spirit or water or cow&rsquo;s urine or milk, in a
boiling state taken in a burning hot metal pot. Angira, Vasishtha and
Paith&#363;rasi restricted the drink to boiling spirits alone. Dewala
went a step farther and prescribed a draught of molten silver, copper
or lead as the most appropriate.... Manu likewise provides for the
judicial cognisance of such offences by Br&#257;hmans, and ordains
excommunication, and branding on the forehead the figure of a bottle as
the most appropriate punishment.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nevertheless the consumption of alcohol was common in
classical times. Bh&#257;radw&#257;ja, a great sage, offered wine to
Bh&#257;rata and his soldiers when they spent a night under his
roof.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10784src" href="#xd21e10784" name=

the southern wilderness she begged the river for a safe passage,
saying, &ldquo;Be merciful to me, O Goddess, and I shall on my return

well-dressed flesh meat.&rdquo; When crossing the Jumna she said,
&ldquo;Be auspicious, O Goddess; I am crossing thee. When my husband
has accomplished his vow I shall worship thee with a thousand head of
cattle and a hundred jars of arrack.&rdquo; Similarly the companions of
Krishna, the Y&#257;davas, destroyed each other when they were overcome
by drink; and many other instances are given by Dr. R&#257;jendra
L&#257;l Mitra. The Pur&#257;nas abound in descriptions of wine and
drinking, and though the object of many of them is to condemn the use
of wine the inference is clear that there was a widespread malady which
they proposed to overcome.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10789src" href=
"#xd21e10789" name="xd21e10789src">19</a> Pulastya, an ancient sage and
author of one of the original Smritis, enumerates twelve different
kinds of liquor, besides the <i>soma</i> beer which is not usually
reckoned under the head of <i>madya</i> or wine, and his successors
have added <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>largely to the list. The twelve principal
liquors of this sage are those of the jack fruit, the grape, honey or
mead, date-liquor, palm-liquor or toddy, sugarcane-liquor,
mahua-liquor, rum and those made from long-pepper, soap-berries and
cocoanuts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10803src" href="#xd21e10803"
name="xd21e10803src">20</a> All these drinks were not merely fermented,
but distilled and flavoured with different kinds of spices, fruits and
herbs; they were thus varieties of spirits or liqueurs. It is probable
that without the use of glass bottles and corks it would be very
difficult to keep fermented wine for any length of time in the Indian
climate. But spirits drunk neat as they were would produce more
markedly evil results in a hot country, and would strengthen and
accelerate the reaction against alcoholic liquor, which has gone so far
that probably a substantial majority at least of the inhabitants of
India are total abstainers. To this good result the adoption of
Buddhism as stated by Dr. Mitra no doubt largely contributed. This was
for some centuries the state religion, and was a strong force in aid of
temperance as well as of abstention from flesh. The Sivite revival
reacted in favour of liquor drinking as well as of the consumption of
drugs. But the prohibition of alcohol has again been a leading tenet of
practically all the Vaishnava reforming sects.</p>

<h3 class="main">8. Drunkenness and divine inspiration.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The intoxication of alcohol is considered by primitive
people as a form of divine inspiration or possession like epileptic
fits and insanity. This is apparently the explanation of the Vedic
liquor, Soma, being deified as one of the greatest gods. In later Hindu
mythology, Varuni, the goddess of wine, was produced when the gods
churned the ocean with the mountain Mandara as a churning-stick on the
back of the tortoise, Vishnu, and the serpent as a rope, for the
purpose of restoring to man the comforts lost during the great
flood.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10813src" href="#xd21e10813" name=
"xd21e10813src">21</a> Varuni was considered to be the consort of
Var&#363;na, the Vedic Neptune.</p>
<p>Similarly the Bacchantes in their drunken frenzy were considered to
be possessed by the wine-god Dionysus. &ldquo;The Aztecs regarded
<i>pulque</i> or the wine of the country as bad, on account of the wild
deeds which men did under its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315"
href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>influence. But these wild
deeds were believed to be the acts, not of the drunken man, but of the
wine-god by whom he was possessed and inspired; and so seriously was
this theory of inspiration held that if any one spoke ill of or
insulted a tipsy man, he was liable to be punished for disrespect to
the wine-god incarnate in his votary.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10829src" href="#xd21e10829" name="xd21e10829src">22</a> Sir
James Frazer thinks that the grape-juice was also considered to be the
blood of the vine. At one time the arrack or rice-beer liquor was also
considered by the Hindus as holy and purifying. Siva says to his
consort: &ldquo;Oh, sweet-speaking goddess, the salvation of
Br&#257;hmans depends on drinking wine.... No one becomes a
Br&#257;hman by repeating the G&#257;yatri, the mother of the Vedas; he
is called a Br&#257;hman only when he has knowledge of Brahma. The
ambrosia of the gods is their Brahma, and on earth it is arrack, and
because one attains the character of a god (<i>suratva</i>) therefore
is arrack called <i>sura</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10841src" href="#xd21e10841" name="xd21e10841src">23</a> The
S&#257;kta Tantras insist upon the use of wine as an element of
devotion. The Kaulas, who are the most ardent followers of the
S&#257;kta Tantras, celebrate their rites at midnight in a closed room,
when they sit in a circle round a jar of country arrack, one or more
young women of a lewd character being in the company; they drink, drink
and drink until they fall down on the ground in utter helplessness,
then rising again they drink in the hope of never having a second
birth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10846src" href="#xd21e10846" name=
"xd21e10846src">24</a> &ldquo;I knew a highly respectable widow lady,
connected with one of the most distinguished families in Calcutta, who
belonged to the Kaula sect, and had survived the 75th anniversary of
her birthday, who never said her prayers (and she did so regularly
every morning and evening) without touching the point of her tongue
with a tooth-pick dipped in a phial of arrack, and sprinkling a few
drops of the liquor on the flowers which she offered to her god. I
doubt very much if she had ever drunk a wine-glassful of arrack at once
in all her life, and certain it is that she never had any idea of the
pleasures of drinking; but as a faithful Kaula she felt herself in duty
bound to observe the mandates of her religion with the <span class=

<h3 class="main">9. Sanctity of liquor among the Gonds and other
castes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Similarly the Gonds and Baigas revere the mahua tree
and consider the liquor distilled from its flowers as sacred and
purificatory. At a Gond wedding the sacred post round which the couple
go is made of the wood of the mahua tree. The Bhatras of Bastar also
use the mahua for the wedding post, and the Sonkars of
Chhatt&#299;sgarh a forked branch of the tree. Minor caste offences are
expiated among the Gonds by a fine of liquor, and by drinking it the
culprit is purified. At a Gond funeral one man may be seen walking with
a bottle or two of liquor slung to his side; this is drunk by all the
party on the spot after the burial or burning of the corpse as a means
of purification. Among the Korwas and other tribes the Baiga or priest
protects the village from ghosts by sprinkling a line of liquor all
round the boundary, over which the ghosts cannot pass. Similarly during
epidemics of cholera liquor is largely used in the rites of the Baigas
for averting the disease and is offered to the goddess. At their
weddings the Mah&#257;rs drink together ceremoniously, a pot of liquor
being placed on a folded cloth and all the guests sitting round it in a
circle. An elder man then lays a new piece of cloth on the pot and
worships it. He takes a cup of the liquor himself and hands round a
cupful to every person present. At the Hareli or festival of the new
green vegetation in July the Gonds take the branches of four kinds of
trees and place them at the corners of their fields and also inside the
house over the door. They pour <i>gh&#299;</i> (butter) on the fire as
incense and an offering to the deities. Then they go to the
meeting-place of the village and there they all take a bottle or two of
liquor each and drink together, having first thrown a little on the
ground as an offering. Then they invite each other to their houses to
take food. The Baigas do not observe Hareli, but on any moonlight night
in Shr&#257;wan (July) they will go to the field where they have sown
grain and root up a few plants and bring them to the house, and, laying
them on a clean place, pour <i>gh&#299;</i> and a little liquor over
them. Then they take the corn plants back <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>to the field and
replace them. For these rites and for offerings to the deities of
disease the Gonds say that the liquor should be distilled at home by
the person who offers the sacrifice and not purchased from the
Government contractor. This is a reason or at any rate an excuse for
the continuance of the practice of illicit distillation. Hindus
generally make a libation to Devi before drinking liquor. They pour a
little into their hand and sprinkle it in a circle on the ground,
invoking the goddess. The palm-tree is also held sacred on account of
the <i>t&#257;ri</i> or toddy obtained from it. &ldquo;The shreds of
the holy palm-tree, holy because liquor-yielding, are worn by some of
the early Konkan tribes and by some of the Konkan village gods. The
strip of palm-leaf is the origin of the shape of one of the favourite
Hindu gold bracelet patterns.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">10. Drugs also considered divine.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The abstinence from liquor enjoined by modern Hinduism
to the higher castes of Hindus has unfortunately not extended to the
harmful drugs, opium, and g&#257;nja<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10885src" href="#xd21e10885" name="xd21e10885src">27</a> or
Indian hemp with its preparations. On the contrary g&#257;nja is
regularly consumed by Hindu ascetics, whether devotees of Siva or
Vishnu, though it is more favoured by the Sivite Jogis. The blue throat
of Siva or Mah&#257;deo is said to be due to the enormous draughts of
<i>bh&#257;ng</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e10891src" href=
"#xd21e10891" name="xd21e10891src">28</a> which he was accustomed to
swallow. The veneration attached to these drugs may probably be
explained by the delusion that the pleasant dreams and visions obtained
under their influence are excursions of the spirit into paradise. It is
a common belief among primitive people that during sleep the soul
leaves the body and that dreams are the actual experiences of the soul
when travelling over the world apart from the body.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e10894src" href="#xd21e10894" name="xd21e10894src">29</a> The
principal aim of Hindu asceticism is also the complete conquest of all
sensation and movement in the body, so that while it is immobile the
spirit freed from the trammels of the body and from all worldly cares
and concerns may, as it is imagined, enter into communion with and be
absorbed in the deity. Hence the physical inertia and abnormal mental
exaltation produced by these drugs would be an ideal condition
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>to the Hindu ascetic; the body is lulled to
immobility and it is natural that he should imagine that the delightful
fantasies of his drugged brain are beatific visions of heaven.
G&#257;nja and bh&#257;ng are now considered sacred as being consumed
by Mah&#257;deo, and are offered to him. Before smoking g&#257;nja a
Hindu will say, &lsquo;May it reach you, Shankar,&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10902src" href="#xd21e10902" name=
"xd21e10902src">30</a> that is, the smoke of the g&#257;nja, like the
sweet savour of a sacrifice; and before drinking bh&#257;ng he will
pour a little on the ground and say &lsquo;Jai Shankar.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10906src" href="#xd21e10906" name=
"xd21e10906src">31</a> Similarly when cholera visits a village and
various articles of dress with food and liquor are offered to the
cholera goddess, Marhai M&#257;ta, smokers of g&#257;nja and
<i>madak</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e10911src" href="#xd21e10911"
name="xd21e10911src">32</a> will offer a little of their drugs. Hindu
ascetics who smoke g&#257;nja are accustomed to mix with it some seeds
of the <i>dhatura</i> (<i>Datura alba</i>), which have a powerful
stupefying effect. In large quantities these seeds are a common
narcotic poison, being administered to travellers and others by
criminals. This tree is sacred to Siva, and the purple and white
flowers are offered on his altars, and probably for this reason it is
often found growing in villages so that the poisonous seeds are readily
available. Its sanctity apparently arises from the narcotic effects
produced by the seeds.</p>
<p>The conclusion of hostilities and ratification of peace after a
Bh&#299;l fight was marked by the solemn administration of opium to all
present by the Jogi or Gammaiti priests.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10922src" href="#xd21e10922" name="xd21e10922src">33</a> This
incident recalls the pipe of peace of the North American Indians, among
whom a similar divine virtue was no doubt ascribed to tobacco. In
ancient Greece the priestesses of Apollo consumed the leaves of the
laurel to produce the prophetic ecstasy; the tree was therefore held
sacred and associated with Apollo and afterwards developed into a
goddess in the shape of Daphne pursued by Apollo and transformed into a
laurel.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10928src" href="#xd21e10928" name=
"xd21e10928src">34</a> The laurel was also considered to have a
purifying or expiatory effect like alcoholic liquor in India. Wreaths
of laurel were worn by such heroes as Apollo and Cadmus before engaging
in battle to cleanse themselves from the pollution of bloodshed, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>hence the laurel-wreath afterwards became the
crown of victory.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10936src" href=
"#xd21e10936" name="xd21e10936src">35</a></p>
<p>In India <i>bh&#257;ng</i> was regularly drunk by the
R&#257;jp&#363;ts before going into battle, to excite their courage and
render them insensible to pain. The effects produced were probably held
to be caused by divine agency. Herodotus says that the Scythians had a
custom of burning the seeds of the hemp plant in religious ceremonies
and that they became intoxicated with the fumes.<a class="noteref" id=

G&#257;nja is the <i>hash&#299;sh</i> of the Old Man of the Mountain
and of Monte Cristo. The term <i>hashsh&#257;sh</i>, meaning &lsquo;a
smoker or eater of hemp,&rsquo; was first applied to Arab warriors in
Syria at the time of the Crusades; from its plural
<i>hashsh&#257;sheen</i> our word assassin is derived.<a class=

<h3 class="main">11. Opium and g&#257;nja.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sacred or divine character attributed to the
Indian drugs in spite of their pernicious effects has thus probably
prevented any organised effort for their prohibition. Buchanan notes
that &ldquo;No more blame follows the use of opium and g&#257;nja than
in Europe that of wine; yet smoking tobacco is considered impure by the
highest castes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10974src" href=
"#xd21e10974" name="xd21e10974src">38</a> It is said, however, that a
Br&#257;hman should abstain from drugs until he is in the last or
ascetic stage of life. In India opium is both eaten and smoked. It is
administered to children almost from the time of their birth, partly
perhaps because its effects are supposed to be beneficial and also to
prevent them from crying and keep them quiet while their parents are at
work. One of the favourite methods of killing female children was to
place a fatal dose of opium on the nipple of the mother&rsquo;s breast.
Many children continue to receive small quantities of opium till they
are several years old, sometimes eight or nine, when it is gradually
abandoned. It can scarcely be doubted that the effect of the drug must
be to impair their health and enfeeble their vitality. The effect of
eating opium on adults is much less pernicious than when the habit of
smoking it is acquired. <i>Madak</i> or opium prepared for smoking may
not now be sold, but people make it for themselves, heating the opium
in a little brass cup over a fire with an infusion of tamarind leaves.
It is then made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320"
name="pb320">320</a>]</span>into little balls and put into the pipe.
Opium-smokers are gregarious and partake of the drug together. As the
fumes mount to their brains, their intellects become enlivened, their
tongues unloosed and the conversation ranges over all subjects in
heaven and earth. This factitious excitement must no doubt be a
powerful attraction to people whose lives are as dull as that of the
average Hindu. And thus they become <i>madakis</i> or confirmed
opium-smokers and are of no more use in life. Dh&#299;mars or fishermen
consume opium and g&#257;nja largely under the impression that these
drugs prevent them from taking cold. G&#257;nja is smoked and is
usually mixed with tobacco. It is much less injurious than opium in the
same form, except when taken in large quantities, and is also slower in
acquiring a complete hold over its votaries. Many cultivators buy a
little g&#257;nja at the weekly baz&#257;r and have one pipeful each as
a treat. Sweepers are greatly addicted to g&#257;nja, and their patron
saint L&#257;lbeg was frequently in a comatose condition from
over-indulgence in the drug. Ah&#299;rs or herdsmen also smoke it to
while away the long days in the forests. But the habitual consumers of
either kind of drug are now only a small fraction of the population,
while English education and the more strenuous conditions of modern
life have effected a substantial decline in their numbers, at least
among the higher classes. At the same time a progressive increase is
being effected by Government in the retail price of the drugs, and the
number of vend licences has been very greatly reduced.</p>
<p>The prohibition of wine to Muhammadans is held to include drugs, but
it is not known how far the rule is strictly observed. But addiction to
drugs is at any rate uncommon among Muhammadans.</p>

<h3 class="main">12. Tobacco.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No kind of sanctity attaches to tobacco and, as has
been seen, certain classes of Br&#257;hmans are forbidden to smoke
though they may chew the leaves. Tobacco is prohibited by the Sikhs,
the Satn&#257;mis and some other Vaishnava sects. The explanation of
this attitude is simple if, as is supposed, tobacco was first
introduced into India by the Portuguese in the fifteenth
century.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10994src" href="#xd21e10994" name=

<h3 class="main">13. Customs in connection with drinking.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The country liquor, consisting of spirits distilled
from the flowers of the mahua tree, is an indispensable adjunct to
marriage and other ceremonial feasts among the lower castes of Hindus
and the non-Aryan tribes. It is usually drunk before the meal out of
brass vessels, cocoanut-shells or leaf-cups, water being afterwards
taken with the food itself. If an offender has to give a penalty feast
for readmission to caste but the whole burden of the expense is beyond
his means, other persons who may have committed minor offences and owe
something to the caste on that account are called upon to provide the
liquor. Similarly at the funeral feast the heir and chief mourner may
provide the food and more distant relatives the liquor. The Gonds never
take food while drinking, and as a rule one man does not drink alone.
Three or four of them go to the liquor-shop together and each in turn
buys a whole bottle of liquor which they share with each other, each
bottle being paid for by one of the company and not jointly. And if a
friend from another village turns up and is invited to drink he is not
allowed to pay anything. In towns there will be in the vicinity of the
liquor-shop retailers of little roasted balls of meat on sticks and
cakes of gram-flour fried in salt and chillies. These the customers
eat, presumably to stimulate their thirst or as a palliative to the
effects of the spirit. Illicit distillation is still habitual among the
Gonds of Mandla, who have been accustomed to make their own liquor from
time immemorial. In the rains, when travelling is difficult and the
excise officers cannot descend on them without notice, they make the
liquor in their houses. In the open season they go to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>the
forest and find some spot secluded behind rocks and also near water.
When the fermented mahua is ready they put up the distilling vat in the
middle of the day so that the smoke may be less perceptible, and one of
them will climb a tree and keep watch for the approach of the Excise
Sub-Inspector and his myrmidons while the other distils. <span class=

Tobacco is no doubt a derivative from some American word, and Platts
derives the Hindi <i>tanb&#257;ku</i> or <i>tamb&#257;ku</i> from
tobacco. The fact that <i>tanb&#257;ku</i> is also Persian for tobacco
militates against the Sanskrit derivation suggested by Mr. Ganpat Rai
and others, and tends to demonstrate its American importation.</p>

<h3 class="main">1. Origin and traditions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Kam&#257;r.</b>&mdash;A small Dravidian tribe
exclusively found in the Raipur District and adjoining States. They
numbered about 7000 persons in 1911, and live principally in the
Khari&#257;r and Bindr&#257;naw&#257;garh zam&#299;nd&#257;ris of
Raipur. In Bengal and Chota N&#257;gpur the term Kam&#257;r is merely
occupational, implying a worker in iron, and similarly Kammala in the
Telugu country is a designation given to the five artisan castes.
Though the name is probably the same the Kam&#257;rs of the Central
Provinces are a purely aboriginal tribe and there is little doubt that
they are an offshoot of the Gonds, nor have they any traditions of ever
having been metal-workers. They claim to be autochthonous like most of
the primitive tribes. They tell a long story of their former
ascendancy, saying that a Kam&#257;r was the original ruler of
Bindr&#257;naw&#257;garh. But a number of Kam&#257;rs one day killed
the <i>bhimr&#257;j</i> bird which had been tamed and taught hawking by
a foreigner from Delhi. He demanded satisfaction, and when it was
refused went to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324"
name="pb324">324</a>]</span>Delhi and brought man-eating soldiers from
there, who ate up all the Kam&#257;rs except one pregnant woman. She
took refuge in a Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s hut in Patna and there had a son,
whom she exposed on a dung-heap for fear of scandal, as she was a widow
at the time. Hence the boy was called Kachra-Dhurwa or rubbish and
dust. This name may be a token of the belief of the Kam&#257;rs that
they were born from the earth as insects generate in dung and decaying
organisms. Similarly one great subtribe of the Gonds are called Dhur or
dust Gonds. Kachra-Dhurwa was endowed with divine strength and severed
the head of a goat made of iron with a stick of bamboo. On growing up
he collected his fellow-tribesmen and slaughtered all the cannibal
soldiers, regaining his ancestral seat in Bindr&#257;naw&#257;garh. It
is noticeable that the Kam&#257;rs call the cannibal soldiers Aghori,
the name of a sect of ascetics who eat human flesh. They still point to
various heaps of lime-encrusted fossils in Bindr&#257;naw&#257;garh as
the bones of the cannibal soldiers. The state of the Kam&#257;rs is so
primitive that it does not seem possible that they could ever have been
workers in iron, but they may perhaps, like the Agarias, be a group of
the Gonds who formerly quarried iron and thus obtained their
distinctive name.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">2. Subdivisions and marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They have two subdivisions, the Bundhrajia and
M&#257;kadia. The latter are so called because they eat monkeys and are
looked down on by the others. They have only a few <i>gots</i> or
septs, all of which have the same names as those of Gond septs. The
meaning of the names has now been forgotten. Their ceremonies also
resemble those of the Gonds, and there can be little doubt that they
are an offshoot of that tribe. Marriage within the sept is prohibited,
but is permitted between the children of brothers and sisters or of two
sisters. Those who are well-to-do marry their children at about ten
years old, but among the bulk of the caste adult-marriage is in
fashion, and the youths and maidens are sometimes allowed to make their
own choice. At the betrothal the boy and girl are made to stand
together so that the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or elders may see the
suitability of the match, and a little wine is sprinkled in the name of
the gods. The marriage ceremony is a simple one, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>marriage-post being erected at the boy&rsquo;s
house. The party go to the girl&rsquo;s house to fetch her, and there
is a feast, followed by a night of singing and dancing. They then
return to the boy&rsquo;s house and the couple go round the sacred pole
and throw rice over each other seven times. All the guests also throw
rice over the couple with the object, it is said, of scaring off the
spirits who are always present on this occasion, and protecting the
bride and bridegroom from harm. But perhaps the rice is really meant to
give fertility to the match. The wife remains with her husband for four
days and then they return to the house of her parents, where the
wedding clothes stained yellow with turmeric must be washed. After this
they again proceed to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house and live together.
Polygamy and widow-marriage are allowed, the ceremony in the marriage
of a widow consisting simply in putting bangles on her wrists and
giving her a piece of new cloth. The Kam&#257;rs never divorce their
wives, however loose their conduct may be, as they say that a lawful
wife is above all suspicion. They also consider it sinful to divorce a
wife. The <i>liaison</i> of an unmarried girl is passed over even with
a man outside the caste, unless he is of a very low caste, such as a
G&#257;nda.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">3. The sister&rsquo;s son.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As among some of the other primitive tribes, a man
stands in a special relation to his sister&rsquo;s children. The
marriage of his children with his sister&rsquo;s children is considered
as the most suitable union. If a man&rsquo;s sister is poor he will
arrange for the wedding of her children. He will never beat his
sister&rsquo;s children, however much they may deserve it, and he will
not permit his sister&rsquo;s son or daughter to eat from the dish from
which he eats. This special connection between a maternal uncle and his
nephew is held to be a survival of the matriarchate, when a man stood
in the place a father now occupies to his sister&rsquo;s children, the
real father having nothing to do with them.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">4. Menstruation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the period of her monthly impurity a woman is
secluded for eight days. She may not prepare food nor draw water nor
worship the gods, but she may sweep the house and do outdoor work. She
sleeps on the ground and every morning spreads fresh cowdung over the
place where she has slept. The Kam&#257;rs think that a man who touched
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>a woman in this condition would be destroyed by
the household god. When a woman in his household is impure in this
manner a man will bathe before going into the forest lest he should
pollute the forest gods.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd21e11143" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Birth customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A woman is impure for six days after a birth until the
performance of the Chathi or sixth-day ceremony, when the child&rsquo;s
head is shaved and the mother and child are bathed and their bodies
rubbed with oil and turmeric. After this a woman can go about her work
in the house, but she may not cook food nor draw water for two and a
half months after the birth of a male child, nor for three months after
that of a female one. Till the performance of the Chathi ceremony the
husband is also impure, and he may not worship the gods or go hunting
or shooting or even go for any distance into the forest. If a child is
born within six months of the death of any person in the family, they
think that the dead relative has been reborn in the child and give the
child the same name, apparently without distinction of sex. If a
mother&rsquo;s milk runs dry and she cannot suckle her child they give
her fresh fish and salt to eat, and think that this will cause the milk
to flow. The idea of eating the fish is probably that being a denizen
of the liquid element it will produce liquid in the mother&rsquo;s
body, but it is not clear whether the salt has any special meaning.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">6. Death and inheritance.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dead are buried with the head to the north, and
mourning is nominally observed for three days. But they have no rules
of abstinence, and do not even bathe to purify themselves as almost all
castes do. Sons inherit equally, and daughters do not share with sons.
But if there are no sons, then an unmarried daughter or one married to
a Lamsena, or man who has served for her, and living in the house,
takes the whole property for her lifetime, after which it reverts to
her father&rsquo;s family. Widows, Mr. Ganpati Giri states, only
inherit in the absence of male heirs.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">7. Religious beliefs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They worship D&#363;lha Deo and Devi, and have a firm
belief in magic. They tell a curious story about the origin of the
world, which recalls that of the Flood. They say that in the beginning
God created a man and a woman to whom two children of opposite sex were
born in their old age. Mah&#257;deo, however, sent a deluge over the
world in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>order to drown a jackal who had angered him. The
old couple heard that there was going to be a deluge, so they shut up
their children in a hollow piece of wood with provision of food to last
them until it should subside. They then closed up the trunk, and the
deluge came and lasted for twelve years, the old couple and all other
living things on the earth being drowned, but the trunk floated on the
face of the waters. After twelve years Mah&#257;deo created two birds
and sent them to see whether his enemy the jackal had been drowned. The
birds flew over all the corners of the world, but saw nothing except a
log of wood floating on the surface of the water, on which they
perched. After a short time they heard low and feeble voices coming
from inside the log. They heard the children saying to each other that
they only had provision for three days left. So the birds flew away and
told Mah&#257;deo, who then caused the flood to subside, and taking out
the children from the log of wood, heard their story. He thereupon
brought them up, and they were married, and Mah&#257;deo gave the name
of a different caste to every child who was born to them, and from them
all the inhabitants of the world are descended. The fact that the
Kam&#257;rs should think their deity capable of destroying the whole
world by a deluge, in order to drown a jackal which had offended him,
indicates how completely they are wanting in any exalted conception of
morality. They are said to have no definite ideas of a future life nor
any belief in a resurrection of the body. But they believe in future
punishment in the case of a thief, who, they say, will be reborn as a
bullock in the house of the man whose property he has stolen, or will
in some other fashion expiate his crime. They think that the sun and
moon are beings in human shape, and that darkness is caused by the sun
going to sleep. They also think that a railway train is a live and
sentient being, and that the whistle of the engine is its cry, and they
propitiate the train with offerings lest it should do them some injury.
When a man purposes to go out hunting, Mr. Ganpati Giri states, he
consults the village priest, who tells him whether he will fail or
succeed. If the prediction is unfavourable he promises a fowl or a goat
to his family god in order to obtain his assistance, and then
confidently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>expects success. When an animal has been killed
and brought home, the hunter cuts off the head, and after washing it
with turmeric powder and water makes an offering of it to the forest
god. Ceremonial fishing expeditions are sometimes held, in which all
the men and women of the village participate, and on such occasions the
favour of the water-goddess is first invoked with an offering of five
chickens and various feminine adornments, such as vermilion, lamp-black
for the eyes, small glass bangles and a knot of ribbons made of cotton
or silk, after which a large catch of fish is anticipated. The men
refrain from visiting their wives on the day before they start for a
hunting or fishing expedition.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">8. Veneration of iron and liquor.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tribe have a special veneration for iron, which
they now say is the emblem of Durga M&#257;ta or the goddess of
smallpox. On their chief festivals of Hareli and Dasahra all iron
implements are washed and placed together in the house, where they are
worshipped with offerings of rice, flowers and incense; nor may any
iron tool be brought into use on this day. On the day appointed for the
worship of D&#363;lha Deo, the bridegroom god, or other important
deities, and on the Dasahra festival, they will not permit fire or
anything else to be taken out of the house. Before drinking liquor they
will pour a few drops on the ground, making a libation first to
mother-earth, then to their family and other important gods, and lastly
to their ancestors.</p>

<h3 class="main">9. Social customs and caste penalties.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kam&#257;rs will eat with all except the very
lowest castes, and do not refuse any kind of food. The Bundhrajias,
however, abstain from the flesh of snakes, crocodiles and monkeys, and
on this account claim to be superior to the M&#257;kadias who eat these
animals. Temporary exclusion from caste is imposed for the usual
offences, and in serious cases, such as adultery with a woman of impure
caste or taking food from her, the penalty is severe. The offender puts
a straw and a piece of iron between his teeth, and stands before the
elders with one leg lifted in his clasped hands. He promises never to
repeat the offence nor permit his children to do so, and falls
prostrate at the feet of each elder, imploring his forgiveness. He
supplies the elders with rice, pulse, salt and vegetables for two days,
and on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>third day he and his family prepare a feast with
one or more goats and two rupees&rsquo; worth of liquor. The elders eat
of this in his house, and readmit him to social intercourse.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">10. Tattooing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The women are tattooed either before or after
marriage, the usual figures being a peacock on the shoulders, a
scorpion on the back of the hand, and dots representing flies on the
fingers. On their arms and legs they have circular lines of dots
representing the ornaments usually worn, and they say that if they are
destitute in the other world they will be able to sell these. This
indicates that the more civilised of them, at any rate, now believe in
a future life. They also have circular dotted lines round the knees
which they say will help them to climb to heaven. Like the Gonds the
men scarify their bodies by burning the outer skin of the forearm in
three or four places with a small piece of burning cloth.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The men shave the whole head on the death of a father
or other venerable relative, but otherwise they never cut their hair,
and let it grow long, twisting it into a bunch at the back of the head.
They shave off or eradicate the hair of the face and pubes, but that on
other parts of the body is allowed to remain. The hair of the head is
considered to be sacred.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tribe wear only the narrowest possible strip of
cloth round the loins, and another strip on the head, one end of which
is often allowed to hang down over the ear. Formerly they lived by
<i>dahya</i> cultivation, burning down patches of forest and scattering
seed on the ground fertilised by the ashes, and they greatly resent the
prohibition of this destructive method. They have now taken to making
baskets and other articles from the wood of the bamboo. They are of
dirty habits, and seldom wash themselves. Forty years ago their manner
of life was even ruder than at present, as shown in the following
notice<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11193src" href="#xd21e11193" name=
"xd21e11193src">2</a> of them by Mr. Ball in 1876:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proceeding along the bed of the valley I came upon two
colonies of a wild race of people called Kam&#257;rs by their
neighbours. They were regular Troglodytes in their habits, dwelling in
caves and existing chiefly on roots and fish. It is singular to observe
how little the people of these wild races do to protect themselves from
the inclemency of the weather. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330"
href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>In one of these caves the
sole protection from the air was a lean-to of loosely placed branches.
The people seemed to be very timid, hiding themselves on our approach.
I did not therefore like to attempt an examination of their dwellings.
After some calling on our part one man was induced to make his
appearance. He was a most wretched-looking, leprous object, having lost
several fingers and toes. He could give no very definite explanation as
to his means of subsistence. All he could say was that he lived
&lsquo;by picking up odds and ends here and there.&rsquo; However, he
seemed to be able to afford himself the solace of tobacco. A few cocks
and hens at one of the caves, and a goat at the other, were the only
domestic animals which I saw.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tribe are of small stature. They are very fond of
hunting, and are expert at using their bows and arrows, with which they
have killed even bison. Mr. W. E. Ley, C.S., relates the following
particulars of a recent murder by a Kam&#257;r in Raipur: Two Hindus
went to a Kam&#257;r&rsquo;s house in the jungle to dun him for a debt.
He could not pay the debt, but invited them to take food in his house.
At the meal the creditor&rsquo;s companion said the food was bad, and a
quarrel thereupon ensuing, slapped the Kam&#257;r in the face. The
latter started up, snatched up his bow and arrow and axe, and ran away
into the jungle. The Hindus then set out for home, and as they were
afraid of being attacked by the Kam&#257;r, they took his brother with
them as a protection. Nevertheless the Kam&#257;r shot one of them
through the side, the arrow passing through the arm and penetrating the
lung. He then shot the other through the chest, and running in,
mutilated his body in a shocking manner. When charged with the murders
he confessed them freely, saying that he was a wild man of the woods
and knew no better. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331"

<h3 class="main">1. Derivation of the Kanjars from the Doms.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Kanjar.</b>&mdash;A name applied somewhat loosely
to various small communities of a gipsy character who wander about the
country. In 1911 about 1000 K&#363;chbandhia Kanjars were returned in
the Province. In Ber&#257;r the Kanjars seem to be practically
identical with the S&#257;nsias; Major Gunthorpe<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11292src" href="#xd21e11292" name="xd21e11292src">1</a> gives
Kanjar and S&#257;nsia as alternative names of the same caste of
criminals, and this is also done by Mr. Kennedy in Bombay.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11297src" href="#xd21e11297" name=
"xd21e11297src">2</a> Mr. Kitts writes of them:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11301src" href="#xd21e11301" name="xd21e11301src">3</a>
&ldquo;The Deccani and M&#257;rw&#257;ri Kanjars were originally
Bh&#257;ts (bards) of the J&#257;t tribe; and as they generally give
themselves out to be Bh&#257;ts are probably not included at all among
the Kanjars returned at the census. They are a vagrant people, living
in tents and addicted to crime. The women are good-looking; some are
noted for their obscene songs, filthy alike in word and gesture; while
others, whose husbands play on the <i>s&#257;rangi</i>, lead a life of
immorality. The men are often skilful acrobats.&rdquo; And in another
passage:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11309src" href="#xd21e11309" name=
"xd21e11309src">4</a> &ldquo;The S&#257;nsia family or the &lsquo;Long
Firm&rsquo; of India includes two principal divisions represented
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>in Ber&#257;r by the Kanjars and Kolh&#257;tis
respectively. They will eat, drink and smoke together, and occasionally
join in committing dacoity. They eat all kinds of meat and drink all
liquors; they are lax of morals and loose of life.&rdquo; Now in
northern India the business of acting as bards to the J&#257;ts and
begging from them is the traditional function of the S&#257;nsias; and
we may therefore conclude that so far as Ber&#257;r and the
Mar&#257;tha Districts are concerned the Kanjars are identical with the
S&#257;nsias, while the Kolh&#257;tis mentioned by Mr. Kitts are the
same people as the Berias, as shown in the article on Kolh&#257;ti, and
the Berias themselves are another branch of the S&#257;nsias.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11315src" href="#xd21e11315" name=
"xd21e11315src">5</a> There seems some reason to suppose that these
four closely allied groups, the Kanjar or S&#257;nsia, and the
Kolh&#257;ti or Beria, may have their origin from the great Dom caste
of menials and scavengers in Hindust&#257;n and Bengal. In the Punjab
the Doms are the regular bards and genealogists of the lower castes,
being known also as Mir&#257;si: &ldquo;The two words are used
throughout the Province as absolutely synonymous. The word Mir&#257;si
is derived from the Arabic <i>mir&#257;s</i> or inheritance; and the
Mir&#257;si is to the inferior agricultural castes and the outcaste
tribes what the Bh&#257;t is to the R&#257;jp&#363;ts.&rdquo;<a class=

the primary calling of the S&#257;nsias was to act as bards and
genealogists of the J&#257;ts; and this common occupation is to some
extent in favour of the original identity of the two castes Dom and
S&#257;nsia, though Sir D. Ibbetson was not of this opinion.<a class=

about the country as though belonging to the Gujar&#257;ti Domtaris or
showmen.&rdquo; The above evidence seems sufficient to establish a
<i>prima facie</i> case in favour of the Dom origin of these gipsy
castes. It may be noticed further that the Jall&#257;d Kanjars of the
United Provinces are also known as S&#363;pw&#257;la or makers of
sieves and winnowing-fans, a calling which belongs specially to the
Doms, Bhangis, and other sweeper castes. Both Doms and Bhangis have
divisions known as B&#257;nsphor or &lsquo;breaker of bamboos,&rsquo; a
name which has the same signification as S&#363;pw&#257;la. Again, the

<h3 class="main">2. The Kanjars and the Gipsies.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kanjars and Berias are the typical gipsy castes of
India, and have been supposed to be the parents of the European
gipsies. On this point Mr. Nesfield writes: &ldquo;The commonly
received legend is that multitudes of Kanjars were driven out of India
by the oppressions of Tamerlane, and it is inferred that the gipsies of
Europe are their direct descendants by blood, because they speak like
them a form of the Hindi language.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11391src" href="#xd21e11391" name="xd21e11391src">17</a> Sir G.
Grierson states:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11397src" href=
"#xd21e11397" name="xd21e11397src">18</a> &ldquo;According to the
Sh&#257;h-n&#257;ma, the Persian monarch Bahr&#257;m Gaur received in
the fifth century from an Indian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334"
href="#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span>king 12,000 musicians who
were known as L&#363;ris, and the L&#363;ris or L&#363;lis, that is
gipsies, of modern Persia are the descendants of these.&rdquo; These
people were also called Lutt, and hence it was supposed that they were
the Indian J&#257;ts. Sir G. Grierson, however, shows it to be highly
improbable that the J&#257;ts, one of the highest castes of
cultivators, could ever have furnished a huge band of professional
singers and dancers. He on the contrary derives the gipsies from the
Dom tribe:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11404src" href="#xd21e11404"
name="xd21e11404src">19</a> &ldquo;Mr. Leland has made a happy
suggestion that the original gipsies may have been Doms of India. He
points out that Romany is almost letter for letter the same as Domni
(<span lang="hi">&#2337;&#2379;&#2350;&#2344;&#2368;</span>), the
plural of Dom. Domni is the plural form in the Bhojpuri dialect of the
Bih&#257;ri language. It was originally a genitive plural; so that
Romany-Rye, &lsquo;A gipsy gentleman,&rsquo; may be well compared with
the Bhojpuri Domni Rai, &lsquo;A king of the Doms.&rsquo; The
Bhojpuri-speaking Doms are a famous race, and they have many points of
resemblance with the gipsies of Europe. Thus they are darker in
complexion than the surrounding Bih&#257;ris, are great thieves, live
by hunting, dancing and telling fortunes, their women have a reputation
for making love-philtres and medicines to procure abortion, they keep
fowls (which no orthodox Hindu will do), and are said to eat carrion.
They are also great musicians and horsemen. The gipsy grammar is
closely connected with Bhojpuri, and the following mongrel, half-gipsy,
half-English rhyme will show the extraordinary similarity of the two
vocabularies:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11413src" href="#xd21e11413"

<p>In the above it must be remembered that the verbal terminations of
the gipsy text are English and not gipsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir G. Grierson also adds (in the passage first quoted): &ldquo;I
may note here a word which lends a singular confirmation to the theory.
It is the gipsy term for bread, which is <i>m&#257;nr&#333;</i> or
<i>manro</i>. This is usually connected either with the Gaudian
<i>m&#257;nr</i> &lsquo;rice-gruel&rsquo; or with <i>manrua</i>, the
millet (<i>Eleusine coracana</i>). Neither of these agrees with the
idea of bread, but in the Magadhi dialect of Bih&#257;ri, spoken south
of the Ganges in the native land of these Maghiya Doms, there is a
peculiar word <i>m&#257;nda</i> or <i>m&#257;nra</i> which means wheat,
whence the transition to the gipsy <i>m&#257;nr&#333;</i>, bread, is
eminently natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above argument renders it probable that the gipsies are derived
from the Doms; and as Mr. Nesfield gives it as a common legend that
they originated from the Kanjars, this is perhaps another connecting
link between the Doms and Kanjars. The word gipsy is probably an
abbreviation of &lsquo;Egyptian,&rsquo; the country assigned as the
home of the gipsies in mediaeval times. It has already been seen that
the Doms are the bards and minstrels of the lower castes in the Punjab,
and that the Kanjars and S&#257;nsias, originally identical or very
closely connected, were in particular the bards of the J&#257;ts. It is
a possible speculation that they may have been mixed up with the lower
classes of J&#257;ts or have taken their name, and that this has led to
the confusion between the J&#257;ts and gipsies. Some support is
afforded to this suggestion by the fact that the Kanjars of Jubbulpore
say that they have three divisions, the J&#257;t, Mult&#257;ni and
K&#363;chbandia. The J&#257;t Kanjars are, no doubt, those who acted as
bards to the J&#257;ts, and hence took the name; and if the ancestors
of these people emigrated from India they may have given themselves out
as J&#257;t. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=

<h3 class="main">3. The Thugs derived from the Kanjars.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the article on Thug it is suggested that a large,
if not the principal, section of the Thugs were derived from the
Kanjars. At the Thug marriages an old matron would sometimes repeat,
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the spirits of those who once led bears and
monkeys; to those who drove bullocks and marked with the <i>godini</i>
(tattooing-needle); and those who made baskets for the head.&rdquo; And
these are the occupations of the Kanjars and Berias. The Goyandas of
Jubbulpore, descendants of Thug approvers, are considered to be a class
of gipsy Muhammadans, akin to or identical with the Kanjars, of whom
the Mult&#257;ni subdivision are also Muhammadans. Like the Kanjar
women the Goyandas make articles of net and string. There is also a
colony of Berias in Jubbulpore, and these are admittedly the
descendants of Thugs who were located there. If the above argument is
well founded, we are led to the interesting conclusion that four of the
most important vagrant and criminal castes of India, as well as the
Mir&#257;sis or low-class Hindu bards, the gipsies, and a large section
of the Thugs, are all derived from the great Dom caste.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. The Doms.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Doms appear to be one of the chief aboriginal
tribes of northern India, who were reduced to servitude like the
Mah&#257;rs and Cham&#257;rs. Sir H. M. Elliot considered them to be
&ldquo;One of the original tribes of India. Tradition fixes their
residence to the north of the Gh&#257;gra, touching the Bhars on the
east in the vicinity of the Rohini. Several old forts testify to their
former importance, and still retain the names of their founders, as,
for instance, Domdiha and Domingarh in the Gorakhpur district.
R&#257;mgarh and Sahukot on the Rohini are also Dom
forts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11703src" href="#xd21e11703"
name="xd21e11703src">21</a> Sir G. Grierson quotes Dr. Fleet as
follows: &ldquo;In a south Indian inscription a king Rudradeva is said
to have subdued a certain Domma, whose strength evidently lay in his
cavalry. No clue is given as to who this Domma was, but he may have
been the leader of some aboriginal tribe which had not then lost all
its power&rdquo;; and suggests that this Domma may have been a leader
of the Doms, who would then be shown to have been dominant in southern
India. As already seen there is a Dom&#257;ru caste of Teling&#257;na,
with whom Mr. Kitts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337"
name="pb337">337</a>]</span>identified the Berias or Kolh&#257;tis. In
northern India the Doms were reduced to a more degraded condition than
the other pre-Aryan tribes as they furnished a large section of the
sweeper caste. As has been seen also they were employed as public
executioners like the M&#257;ngs. This brief mention of the Doms has
been made in view of the interest attaching to them on account of the
above suggestions, and because there will be no separate article on the
caste.</p>

<h3 class="main">5. The criminal Kanjars.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Ber&#257;r two main divisions of the Kanjars may be
recognised, the K&#363;nchbandhia or those who make weavers&rsquo;
brooms and are comparatively honest, and the other or criminal
Kanjars.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11713src" href="#xd21e11713" name=
"xd21e11713src">22</a> The criminal Kanjars may again be divided into
the M&#257;rw&#257;ri and Deccani groups. They were probably once the
same, but the Deccanis, owing to their settlement in the south, have
adopted some Mar&#257;tha or Gujar&#257;ti fashions, and speak the
Mar&#257;thi language; their women wear the <i>angia</i> or
Mar&#257;tha breast-cloth fastening behind, and have a gold ornament
shaped like a flower in the nose;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11722src"
href="#xd21e11722" name="xd21e11722src">23</a> while the
M&#257;rw&#257;ri Kanjars have no breast-cloth and may not wear gold
ornaments at all. The Deccani Kanjars are fond of stealing donkeys,
their habit being either to mix their own herds with those of the
village and drive them all off together, or, if they catch the donkeys
unattended, to secrete them in some water-course, tying their legs
together, and if they remain undiscovered to remove them at nightfall.
The animals are at once driven away for a long distance before any
attempt is made to dispose of them. The M&#257;rw&#257;ri Kanjars
consider it derogatory to keep donkeys and therefore do not steal these
animals. They are preeminently cattle-lifters and sheep-stealers, and
their encampments may be recognised by the numbers of bullocks and cows
about them. Their women wear the short M&#257;rw&#257;ri petticoat
reaching half-way between the knees and ankles. Their hair is plaited
over the forehead and cowrie shells and brass ornaments like buttons
are often attached in it. Bead necklaces are much worn by the women and
bead and horse-hair necklets by the men. A peculiarity about the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>women is that they are confirmed snuff-takers
and consume great quantities of the weed in this form. The women go
into the towns and villages and give exhibitions of singing and
dancing; and picking up any information they can acquire about the
location of property, impart this to the men. Sometimes they take
service, and a case was known in Jubbulpore of Kanjar women hiring
themselves out as pankha-pullers, with the result that the houses in
which they were employed were subsequently robbed.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e11733src" href="#xd21e11733" name="xd21e11733src">24</a> It is
said, however, that they do not regularly break into houses, but
confine themselves to lurking theft. I have thought it desirable to
record here the above particulars of the criminal Kanjars, taken from
Major Gunthorpe&rsquo;s account; for, though the caste is, as already
stated, identical with the S&#257;nsias, their customs in Ber&#257;r
differ considerably from those of the S&#257;nsias of Central India,
who are treated of in the article on that caste.</p>

<h3 class="main">6. The K&#363;nchband Kanjars.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We come, finally, to the K&#363;nchband Kanjars, the
most representative section of the caste, who as a body are not
criminals, or at any rate less so than the others. The name
K&#363;nchband or K&#363;chband, by which they are sometimes known, is
derived from their trade of making brushes (<i>k&#363;nch</i>) of the
roots of <i>khas-khas</i> grass, which are used by weavers for cleaning
the threads entangled on the looms. This has given rise to the proverb
&lsquo;<i>Kori ka big&#257;ri K&#363;nchbandhia</i>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;The K&#363;nchbandhia must look to the Kori (weaver) as his
patron&rsquo;; the point being that the Kori is himself no better than
a casual labourer, and a man who is dependent on him must be in a poor
way indeed. The K&#363;nchbandhias are also known in northern India as
Sankat or Patharkat, because they make and sharpen the household
grinding-stones, this being the calling of the T&#257;kank&#257;r
P&#257;rdhis in the Mar&#257;tha Districts, and as Goher because they
catch and eat the <i>goh</i>, the large lizard or iguana.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11756src" href="#xd21e11756" name=
"xd21e11756src">25</a> Other divisions are the Dhobibans or
washerman&rsquo;s race, the Lakarh&#257;r or wood-cutters, and the
Untw&#257;r or camelmen.</p>

<h3 class="main">7. Marriage and religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Central Provinces there are other divisions, as
the J&#257;t and Mult&#257;ni Kanjars. They say they have two exogamous
divisions, Kalkha and Malha, and a member of either of these must take
a wife from the other division. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339"
href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>Both the Kalkhas and Malhas
are further divided into <i>kuls</i> or sections, but the influence of
these on marriage is not clear. At a Kanjar marriage, Mr. Crooke
states, the <i>gadela</i> or spade with which they dig out the
<i>khas-khas</i> grass and kill wolves or vermin, is placed in the
marriage pavilion during the ceremony. The bridegroom swears that he
will not drive away nor divorce his wife, and sometimes a <i>mehar</i>
or dowry is also fixed for the bride. The father-in-law usually,
however, remits a part or the whole of this subsequently, when the
bridegroom goes to take food at his house on festival occasions. Mr.
Nesfield states that the principal deity of the Kanjars is the man-god
M&#257;na, who was not only the teacher and guide, but also the founder
and ancestor of the tribe. He is buried, as some Kanjars relate, at
Kara in the Allah&#257;b&#257;d District, not far from the Ganges and
facing the old city of M&#257;nikpur on the opposite bank. M&#257;na is
worshipped with special ceremony in the rainy season, when the tribe is
less migratory than in the dry months of the year. On such occasions,
if sufficient notice is circulated, several encampments unite
temporarily to pay honour to their common ancestor. The worshippers
collect near a tree under which they sacrifice a pig, a goat, a sheep,
or a fowl, and make an offering of roasted flesh and spirituous liquor.
Formerly, it is said, they used to sacrifice a child, having first made
it insensible with fermented palm-juice or toddy.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11782src" href="#xd21e11782" name="xd21e11782src">26</a> They
dance round the tree in honour of M&#257;na, and sing the customary
songs in commemoration of his wisdom and deeds of valour.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dead are usually buried, both male and female
corpses being laid on their faces with the feet pointing to the south.
Kanjars who become Muhammadans may be readmitted to the community after
the following ceremony. A pit is dug and the convert sits in it and
each Kanjar throws a little curds on to his body. He then goes and
bathes in a river, his tongue is touched or branded with heated gold
and he gives a feast to the community. A Kanjar woman who has lived in
concubinage with a Br&#257;hman, R&#257;jp&#363;t, Agarw&#257;l Bania,
Kurmi, Ah&#299;r or Lodhi may be taken back <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>into
the caste after the same ceremony; but not one who has lived with a
K&#257;yasth, Sun&#257;r or Loh&#257;r or any lower caste. A Kanjar is
not put out of caste for being imprisoned, nor for being beaten by an
outsider, nor for selling shoes. If a man touches his daughter-in-law
even accidentally he is fined the sum of Rs. 2&ndash;8.</p>

<h3 class="main">9. Industrial arts.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following account of the industries of the vagrant
Kanjars was written by Mr. Nesfield in 1883. In the Central Provinces
many of them are now more civilised, and some are employed in
Government service. Their women also make and retail string-net purses,
balls and other articles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the arts of the Kanjar are making mats of the
<i>sirki</i> reed, baskets of wattled cane, fans of palm-leaves and
rattles of plaited straw: these last are now sold to Hindu children as
toys, though originally they may have been used by the Kanjars
themselves (if we are to trust to the analogy of other backward races)
as sacred and mysterious implements. From the stalks of the <i>munj</i>
grass and from the roots of the <i>pal&#257;s</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11808src" href="#xd21e11808" name="xd21e11808src">27</a> tree
they make ropes which are sold or bartered to villagers in exchange for
grain and milk. They prepare the skins of which drums are made and sell
them to Hindu musicians; though, probably, as in the case of the
rattle, the drum was originally used by the Kanjars themselves and
worshipped as a fetish; for even the Aryan tribes, who are said to have
been far more advanced than the indigenous races, sang hymns in honour
of the drum or <i>dundubhi</i> as if it were something sacred. They
make plates of broad leaves which are ingeniously stitched together by
their stalks; and plates of this kind are very widely used by the
inferior Indian castes and by confectioners and sellers of sweetmeats.
The mats of <i>sirki</i> reed with which they cover their own movable
leaf huts are models of neatness and simplicity and many of these are
sold to cart-drivers. The toddy or juice of the palm tree, which they
extract and ferment by methods of their own and partly for their own
use, finds a ready sale among low-caste Hindus in villages and market
towns. They are among the chief stone-cutters in Upper India,
especially in the manufacture of the grinding-mill <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>which is very widely used. This consists of two
circular stones of equal diameter; the upper one, which is the thicker
and heavier, revolves on a wooden pivot fixed in the centre of the
lower one and is propelled by two women, each holding the same handle.
But it is also not less frequent for one woman to grind alone.&rdquo;
It is perhaps not realised what this business of grinding her own grain
instead of buying flour means to the Indian woman. She rises before
daybreak to commence the work, and it takes her perhaps two or three
hours to complete the day&rsquo;s provision. Grain-grinding for hire is
an occupation pursued by poor women. The <i>pisanh&#257;ri</i>, as she
is called, receives an anna (penny) for grinding 16 lbs. of grain, and
can get through 30 lbs. a day. In several localities temples are shown
supposed to have been built by some pious <i>pisanh&#257;ri</i> from
her earnings. &ldquo;The Kanjars,&rdquo; Mr. Nesfield continues,
&ldquo;also gather the white wool-like fibre which grows in the pods of
the <i>semal</i> or Indian cotton tree and twist it into thread for the
use of weavers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11830src" href="#xd21e11830"
name="xd21e11830src">28</a> In the manufacture of brushes for the
cleaning of cotton-yarn the Kanjars enjoy almost a complete monopoly.
In these brushes a stiff mass of horsehair is attached to a wooden
handle by sinews and strips of hide; and the workmanship is remarkably
neat and durable.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11833src" href=
"#xd21e11833" name="xd21e11833src">29</a> Another complete or almost
complete monopoly enjoyed by Kanjars is the collection and sale of
sweet-scented roots of the <i>khas-khas</i> grass, which are afterward
made up by the Chhaparbands and others into door-screens, and through
being continually watered cool the hot air which passes through them.
The roots of this wild grass, which grows in most abundance on the
outskirts of forests or near the banks of rivers, are dug out of the
earth by an instrument called <i>khunti</i>. This has a handle three
feet long, and a blade about a foot long resembling that of a knife.
The same implement serves as a dagger or short spear for killing wolves
or jackals, as a tool for carving a secret entrance through the clay
wall of a villager&rsquo;s hut in which a burglary is meditated, as a
spade or hoe for digging <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href=
"#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>snakes, field-rats, and lizards
out of their holes, and edible roots out of the earth, and as a hatchet
for chopping wood.&rdquo;</p>

<b>Munurw&#257;r</b>.&mdash;A great cultivating caste of the Telugu
country, where they are known as K&#257;pu or Reddi, and correspond to
the Kurmi in Hindust&#257;n and the Kunbi in the Mar&#257;tha
Districts. In the Central Provinces about 18,000 persons of the caste
were enumerated in the Ch&#257;nda District and Ber&#257;r in 1911. The
term K&#257;pu means a watchman, and Reddi is considered to be a
corruption of R&#257;thor or R&#257;shtrak&#363;ta, meaning a king, or
more properly the headman of a village. K&#257;pew&#257;r is simply the
plural form of K&#257;pu, and Munurw&#257;r, in reality the name of a
subcaste of K&#257;pew&#257;rs, is used as a synonym for the main caste
in Ch&#257;nda. They are divided into various occupational subcastes,
as the Upparwars or earth-diggers, from <i>uppar</i>, earth; the Gone,
who make <i>gonas</i> or hemp gunny-bags; the Elmas, who are household
servants; the Gollew&#257;rs, who sell milk; and the Gamadis or masons.
The Kunte or lame K&#257;pew&#257;rs, the lowest group, say that their
ancestor was born lame; they are also called Bhiksha Kunte or lame
beggars and serve as the bards of the caste besides begging from them.
They are considered to be of illegitimate origin. No detailed account
of the caste need be given here, but one or two interesting customs
reported from Ch&#257;nda may be noted. Girls must be married before
they are ten years old, and in default of this the parents are
temporarily put out of caste and have to pay a penalty for readmission.
But if they take the girl to some sacred place on the God&#257;vari
river and marry her there the penalty is avoided. Contrary to the usual
custom the bride goes to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house to be married. On
the fourth night of the marriage ceremony the bridegroom takes with him
all the parts of a plough as if he was going out to the field, and
walks up the marriage-shed to the further end followed by the bride,
who carries on her head some cooked food tied up in a cloth. The skirts
of the couple are knotted together. On reaching the end of the shed the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>bridegroom makes five drills in the ground with
a bullock-goad and sows cotton and ju&#257;ri seeds mixed together.
Then the cooked food is eaten by all who are present, the bridal couple
commencing first, and the seed is irrigated by washing their hands over
it. This performance is a symbolical portrayal of the future life of
the couple, which will be spent in cultivation. In Ch&#257;nda a number
of K&#257;pew&#257;rs are stone-masons, and are considered the most
proficient workers at this trade in the locality. Major Lucie Smith,
the author of the <i>Ch&#257;nda Settlement Report</i> of 1869, thought
that the ancestors of the caste had been originally brought to
Ch&#257;nda to build the fine walls with ramparts and bastions which
stretch for a length of six or seven miles round the town. The caste
are sometimes known as Telugu Kunbis. Men may be distinguished by the
single dot which is always tattooed on the forehead during their
infancy. Men of the Gow&#257;ri caste have a similar mark.</p>

href="#xd21e11881" name="xd21e11881src">1</a> <b>Karnam</b>,
<b>Mahanti</b>.&mdash;The indigenous writer caste of Orissa. In 1901 a
total of 5000 Karans were enumerated in Sambalpur and the Uriya States,
but the bulk of these have since passed under the jurisdiction of
Bih&#257;r and Orissa, and only about 1000 remain in the Central
Provinces. The total numbers of the caste in India exceed a quarter of
a million. The poet K&#257;lid&#257;s in his R&#257;ghuvansa describes
Karans as the offspring of a Vaishya father and a S&#363;dra mother.
The caste fulfils the same functions in Orissa as the K&#257;yasths
elsewhere, and it is said that their original ancestors were brought
from northern India by Yay&#257;ti Kesari, king of Orissa (<span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 447&ndash;526), to supply the demand for writers and
clerks. The original of the word Karan is said to be the Hindi
<i>kar&#257;ni</i>, <i>kir&#257;n</i>, which Wilson derives from
Sanskrit <i>karan</i>, &lsquo;a doer.&rsquo; The word
<i>kar&#257;ni</i> was at one time applied by natives to the junior
members of the Civil Service&mdash;&lsquo;Writers,&rsquo; as they were
designated. And the &lsquo;Writers&rsquo; Buildings&rsquo; of Calcutta
were known as <i>kar&#257;ni kibar&#299;k</i>. From this term a
corruption &lsquo;Cranny&rsquo; came into use, and was applied in
Bengal to a clerk writing English, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344"
href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>and thence to the East
Indians or half-castes from whom English copyists were subsequently
recruited.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11911src" href="#xd21e11911"
name="xd21e11911src">2</a> The derivation of Mahanti is obscure, unless
it be from <i>maha</i>, great, or from Mahant, the head of a monastery.
The caste prefer the name of Karan, because that of Mahanti is often
appropriated by affluent Chasas and others who wish to get a rise in
rank. In fact a proverb says: <i>J&#257;r nah&#299;n J&#257;ti,
t&#257;ku bolanti Mahanti</i>, or &lsquo;He who has no caste calls
himself a Mahanti.&rsquo; The Karans, like the K&#257;yasths, claim
Chitragupta as their first ancestor, but most of them repudiate any
connection with the K&#257;yasths, though they are of the same calling.
The Karans of Sambalpur have two subcastes, the Jh&#257;dua or those of
the <i>jh&#257;di</i> or jungle and the Utkali or Uriyas. The former
are said to be the earlier immigrants and are looked down on by the
latter, who do not intermarry with them. Their exogamous divisions or
<i>gotras</i> are of the type called eponymous, being named after
well-known Rishis or saints like those of the Br&#257;hmans. Instances
of such names are Bh&#257;radw&#257;j, Par&#257;sar, V&#257;lm&#299;k
and Vasishtha. Some of the names, however, are in a manner totemistic,
as N&#257;gas, the cobra; Kounchhas, the tortoise; Bach&#257;s, a calf,
and so on. These animals are revered by the members of the <i>gotra</i>
named after them, but as they are of semi-divine nature, the practice
may be distinguished from true totemism. In some cases, however,
members of the Bh&#257;radw&#257;j <i>gotra</i> venerate the blue-jay,
and of the Par&#257;sar <i>gotra</i>, a pigeon. Marriage is regulated
according to the table of prohibited degrees in vogue among the higher
castes. Girls are commonly married before they are ten years old, but
no penalty attaches to the postponement of the ceremony to a later age.
The binding portion of the marriage is Hastabandhan or the tying of the
hands of the couple together with <i>kusha</i> grass,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e11942src" href="#xd21e11942" name="xd21e11942src">3</a> and
when this has been done the marriage cannot be annulled. The bride goes
to her husband&rsquo;s house for a few days and then returns home until
she attains maturity. Divorce and remarriage of widows are prohibited,
and an unfaithful wife is finally expelled from the caste. The Karans
worship the usual Hindu gods and call themselves Sm&#257;rths. Some
belong to the local Parm&#257;rth and Kumbh&#299;patia sects, the
former of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=

dead, excepting the bodies of infants, and perform the
<i>shr&#257;ddh</i> ceremony. The caste have a high social position in
Sambalpur, and Br&#257;hmans will sometimes take food cooked without
water from them. They wear the sacred thread. They eat fish and the
flesh of clean animals but do not drink liquor. Bhand&#257;ris or
barbers will take <i>katcha</i> food from a Karan. They are generally
engaged in service as clerks, accountants, schoolmasters or
patw&#257;ris. Their usual titles are Patn&#257;ik or Bohid&#257;r. The
Karans are considered to be of extravagant habits, and one proverb
about them is&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="main">1. General notice of the caste.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Kasai</b>, <b>Kass&#257;b</b>.&mdash;The caste of
Muhammadan butchers, of whom about 4000 persons were returned from the
Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r in 1911. During the last decade the
numbers of the caste have very greatly increased owing to the rise of
the cattle-slaughtering industry. Two kinds of Kasais may be
distinguished, the Gai Kasai or cow-killers and the Bakar Kasai or
mutton butchers. The latter, however, are usually Hindus and have been
formed into a separate caste, being known as Khat&#299;k. Like other
Muhammadans who have adopted professions of a not too reputable nature,
the Kasais have become a caste, partly because the ordinary Muhammadan
declines to intermarry with them, and partly no doubt in imitation of
the Hindu social system. The Kasais are one of the lowest of the
Muhammadan castes, and will admit into their community even low-caste
Hindu converts. They celebrate their weddings by the <i>nik&#257;h</i>
form, but until recently many Hindu rites were added <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>to
it. The K&#257;zi is employed to conduct the marriage, but if his
services are not available a member of the caste may officiate instead.
Polygamy is permitted to the number of four wives. A man may divorce
his wife simply for disobedience, but if a woman wishes to divorce her
husband she must forego the Meher or dowry promised at the time of the
wedding. The Kasai women, perhaps owing to their meat diet, are
noticeably strong and well nourished, and there is a saying to the
effect that, &lsquo;The butcher&rsquo;s daughter will bear children
when she is ten years old.&rsquo; The deities of the Kasais are a
number of Muhammadan saints, who are known as Aulia or Favourites of
God. The caste bury the dead, and on the third day they read the Kalma
over some parched grain and distribute this to the caste-fellows, who
eat it in the name of the deceased man, invoking a blessing upon him.
On the ninth day after the death they distribute food to Muhammadan
Fak&#299;rs or beggars, and on the twentieth and fortieth days two more
feasts are given to the caste and a third on the anniversary of the
death. Owing to what is considered the degrading nature of his
occupation, the social position of the Kasai is very low, and there is
a saying&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="main">2. The cattle-slaughtering industry.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In recent years an extensive industry in the slaughter
of cattle has sprung up all over the Province. Worn-out animals are now
eagerly bought up and killed; their hides are dried and exported, and
the meat is cured and sent to Madras and Burma, a substantial profit
being obtained from its sale. The blood, horns and hoofs are other
products which yield a return. The religious scruples of the Hindus
have given way to the temptation of obtaining what is to them a
substantial sum for a valueless animal, and, with the exception perhaps
of Br&#257;hmans and Banias, all castes now dispose of their useless
cattle to the butchers. At first this <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb348" href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span>was done by stealth,
and efforts were made to impose severe penalties on anybody guilty of
the crime of being accessory to the death of the sacred kine, while it
is said that the emissaries of the butchers were sent to the markets
disguised as Br&#257;hmans or religious mendicants, and pretended that
they wished to buy cattle in order to preserve their lives as a
meritorious act. But such attempts at restriction have generally proved
fruitless, and the trade is now openly practised and acquiesced in by
public opinion. In spite of many complaints of the shortage of plough
cattle caused by the large numbers of animals slaughtered, the results
of this traffic are probably almost wholly advantageous; for the
villages no longer contain a horde of worn-out and decrepit animals to
deprive the valuable plough and milch cattle of a share of the too
scanty pasturage. Kasais themselves are generally prosperous.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Muhammadan rite of <i>zibah</i> or
<i>hal&#257;l</i>.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When killing an animal the butcher lays it on the
ground with its feet to the west and head stretched towards the north
and then cuts its throat saying:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">In the name of God;</p>
<p class="line">God is great.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This method of killing an animal is known as
<i>zibah</i>. The Muhammadan belief that an animal is not fit for food
unless its throat has been cut so that the blood flows on to the ground
is thus explained in Professor Robertson Smith&rsquo;s <i>Religion of
the Semites</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e12144src" href="#xd21e12144"
name="xd21e12144src">1</a>: &ldquo;In heathen Canaan all the animals
belonged to the god of the country; but it was lawful to kill them if
payment was made to the god by pouring out their life or blood on the
ground.&rdquo; The Arabs are of the same Semitic stock, and this may be
partly the underlying idea of their rite of <i>zibah</i>. It seems
doubtful, however, whether the explanation suffices to explain its
continuance for so long a period among the Muhammadans who have long
ceased to reverence any earth-deity, and in a foreign country where the
soil cannot be sacred to them; and a short summary of Dr. Robertson
Smith&rsquo;s luminous explanation of the underlying principle of
animal sacrifice in early times seems requisite to its full
understanding. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=

<h3 class="main">4. Animism.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Primitive man did not recognise any difference of
intelligence and self-consciousness between himself and the lower
animals and even plants, but believed them all to be possessed of
consciousness and volition as he was. He knew of no natural laws of the
constitution of matter and the action of forces, and therefore thought
that all natural phenomena, the sun, moon and stars, the wind and rain,
were similarly appearances, manifestations or acts of volition of
beings conscious like himself. This is what is meant by animism. Among
several races the community was divided into totem-clans, and each clan
held sacred some animal or bird, which was considered as a kinsman. All
the members of the clan were kin to each other through the tie formed
by their eating their totem animal, which in the hunting stage was
probably their chief means of subsistence, and from which they
consequently thought that they derived their common life.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12157src" href="#xd21e12157" name=
"xd21e12157src">2</a> In process of time the animals which were
domesticated, such as the horse, the sheep, the cow and the camel,
acquired a special sanctity, and became, in fact, the principal deities
of the community, such as the calf-god Apis, the cow-goddess
Isis-Hathor, and the ram-god Amen in Egypt, Hera, probably a
cow-goddess, and Dionysus, who may be the deified bull or goat (or a
combination of them) in Greece, and so on.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Animal-gods. The domestic animals.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is easy to see how these domestic animals would
overshadow all others in importance when the tribe had arrived at the
pastoral or agricultural stage; thus in the former the camel, horse,
goat or sheep, and in the latter pre-eminently the bull and cow, as the
animals which afforded subsistence to the whole tribe, would become
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>greatest gods. It must be presumed that men
forgot that their ancestors had tamed these animals, and looked on them
as divine helpers who of their own free will had come to give mankind
their aid in gaining a subsistence. Those who have observed the
reverence paid to the cow and bull in India will have no difficulty in
realising this point of view. Many other instances can be obtained.
Thus in the Vedic religion of the Aryans the Ashvins, from
<i>ashva</i>, a horse, were the divine horsemen of the dawn or of the
sun. The principal sacrifice was that of the horse, considered,
perhaps, as the representative of the sun or carrier of celestial fire.
In a hymn the horse is said to be sprung from the gods. In Greece
Phaethon was the charioteer of the horses of the sun. Mars, as the
Roman god of war, may perhaps have been the deified horse, as suggested
later. The chieftains of the Anglo-Saxon invaders of England, Hengist
and Horsa, were held to be descended from the god Odin, to whom horses
were sacrificed; Hengist means a stallion and Horsa a horse, the word
having survived in modern English. Other mythical kings in Bede&rsquo;s
chronicle have names derived from that of the horse
(<i>vicg.</i>).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12176src" href="#xd21e12176"
name="xd21e12176src">3</a> The camel does not seem to have become an
anthropomorphic god, but the Arabs venerated it and refrained from
killing it except as a sacrifice, when it was offered to the
Morning-Star and partaken of sacramentally by the worshippers as will
be seen subsequently. The ox as the tiller of the ground, with the cow
as milk-giver and mother of the ox, are especially venerated by races
in the early agricultural stage. Egyptian and Greek instances have
already been given. In modern Egypt, as in India, bulls are let loose
and held sacred. &ldquo;Sometimes a peasant vows that he will
sacrifice, for the sake of a saint, a calf which he possesses, as soon
as it is full grown and fatted. It is let loose, by consent of all his
neighbours, to pasture where it will, even in fields of young wheat;
and at last, after it has been sacrificed, a public feast is made with
its meat. Many a large bull is thus given away.&rdquo;<a class=

href="#xd21e12200" name="xd21e12200src">7</a> The monotheistic religion
of Persia, Mitraism, which was an outcome of the faith of Zoroaster,
and being introduced by the Emperors Commodus and Julian into the Roman
world contended for some time with Christianity, was apparently
sun-worship, Mitra being the sun-god of the ancient Aryans and
Iranians; M. Reinach says: &ldquo;Mitra is born from a rock; he makes
water flow from the rock by striking it with an arrow, makes an
alliance with the sun, and enters into a struggle with a bull, whom he
conquers and sacrifices. The sacrifice of the bull appears to indicate
that the worship of Mitra in its most ancient form was that of a sacred
bull, conjoined to or representing the sun, which was sacrificed as a
god, and its flesh and blood eaten in a sacrificial meal. Mitra, the
slayer of the bull, figures in a double r&ocirc;le as one finds in all
the religions which have passed from totemism to
anthropomorphism.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12205src" href=

"#xd21e12229" name="xd21e12229src">12</a> The veneration of the bull
survived into Christian England in the Middle Ages. &ldquo;At St.
Edmundsbury a white bull, which enjoyed full ease and plenty in the
fields, and was never yoked to the plough nor employed in any service,
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=

"xd21e12244src" href="#xd21e12244" name="xd21e12244src">14</a> and the
belief in their efficacy must apparently have arisen from the sanctity
attaching to the animal. In India Siva rides upon the bull Nandi, and
when the Kunbis were too weak from famine to plough the fields, he had
Nandi castrated and harnessed to the plough, thus teaching them to use
oxen for ploughing; the image of Nandi is always carved in stone in
front of Siva, and there seems little reason to doubt that in his
beneficent aspect of Mah&#257;deo the god was originally the deified
bull. Bulls were let loose in his honour and allowed to graze where
they would, and formerly a good Hindu would not even sell a bull,
though this rule has fallen into abeyance. The sacred cow,
K&#257;mdhenu, was the giver of all wealth in Hindu mythology, and
Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, is considered to have been the deified
cow. Hindus are purified from grave offences by drinking the five
products of the sacred cow, milk, curds, butter, dung and urine; and
the floors of Hindu houses are daily plastered with cowdung to the same
end.</p>

association with Mars, as the sacrifice most pleasing to him, leaves no
doubt as to the primitive nature of the god. It was a wolf which acted
as guide to the Samnites in their search for a place to settle in, and
these Samnites called themselves Hirpi or Hirpini, that is to say,
wolves. Romulus and Remus, sons of the wolf Mars and the she-wolf

was at first an agricultural deity, the wolf being worshipped by the
shepherd and farmer because he was their principal enemy, as the

Indian cultivators. At a later period, in becoming the god of war, he
may have represented the deified horse as well. Races of war-horses
were held at his festivals on 14th March and 27th February, and a great

originally the watch-dog, or in his more terrible character of the

<h3 class="main">8. The sacrificial meal.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The original sacrifice was that in which the community
of kinsmen ate together the flesh of their divine or totem animal-god
and drank its blood. In early religion the tribal god was the ancestor
and relative of the tribe. He protected and fostered the tribe in its
public concerns, but took no special care of individuals; the only
offences of which he took cognisance were those against the tribe as a
whole, such as shedding a kinsman&rsquo;s blood. At periodical
intervals the tribe renewed their kinship with the god and each other
by eating his flesh together at a sacrificial meal by which they
acquired his divine attributes; and every tribesman was not only
invited, but bound, to participate. &ldquo;According to antique ideas
those who eat and drink together are by this very act tied to one
another by a bond of friendship <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355"
href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>and mutual obligation. Hence
when we find that in ancient religions all the ordinary functions of
worship are summed up in the sacrificial meal, and that the ordinary
intercourse between gods and men has no other form, we are to remember
that the act of eating and drinking together is the solemn and stated
expression of the fact that all who share the meal are brethren, and
that the duties of friendship and brotherhood are implicitly
acknowledged in their common act.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12318src"
href="#xd21e12318" name="xd21e12318src">24</a> The one thing directly
expressed in the sacrificial meal is that the god and his worshippers
are <i>commensals</i>, but every other point in their mutual relations
is included in what this involves. Those who sit at meat together are
united for all social effects; those who do not eat together are aliens
to one another, without fellowship in religion and without reciprocal
social duties. The extent to which this view prevailed among the
ancient Semites, and still prevails among the Arabs, may be brought out
most clearly by reference to the law of hospitality. Among the Arabs
every stranger whom one meets in the desert is a natural enemy, and has
no protection against violence except his own strong hand or the fear
that his tribe will avenge him if his blood be spilt. But if I have
eaten the smallest morsel of food with a man I have nothing further to
fear from him; &lsquo;there is salt between us,&rsquo; and he is bound
not only to do me no harm, but to help and defend me as if I were his
brother. So far was this principle carried by the old Arabs that
Zaid-al-Khail, a famous warrior in the days of Muhammad, refused to
slay a vagabond who carried off his camels, because the thief had
surreptitiously drunk from his father&rsquo;s milk-bowl before
committing the theft.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12326src" href=
"#xd21e12326" name="xd21e12326src">25</a> It is in this idea that the
feeling of hospitality originally arose. Those who ate together the
sacred food consisting of the body of the god were brothers, and bound
to assist each other and do each other no harm; and the obligation
extended in a modified form to all food partaken of together, more
especially as with some races, as the ancient Romans and the Hindus,
all the regular household meals are sacred; they may only be partaken
of after purifying the body, and a portion of the food at each meal is
offered to the gods. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356"
name="pb356">356</a>]</span>&ldquo;There was a sworn alliance between
the Lihy&#257;n and the Mostalic&mdash;they were wont to eat and drink
together. This phrase of an Arab narrator supplies exactly what is
wanted to define the significance of the sacrificial meal. The god and
his worshippers are wont to eat and drink together, and by this token
their fellowship is declared and sealed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">9. Primitive basis of kinship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The primitive idea of kinship rested on this
participation in the sacrificial meal, and not on blood-relationship.
&ldquo;In ancient times the fundamental obligations of kinship had
nothing to do with degrees of relationship, but rested with absolute
and identical force on every member of the clan. To know that a
man&rsquo;s life was sacred to me and that every blood-feud that
touched him involved me also, it was not necessary for me to count
cousinship with him by reckoning up to our common ancestor; it was
enough that we belonged to the same clan and bore the same clan-name.
What was my clan was determined by customary law, which was not the
same in all stages of society; in the earliest Semitic communities a
man was of his mother&rsquo;s clan, in later times he belonged to the
clan of his father. But the essential idea of kinship was independent
of the particular form of the law. A kin was a group of persons whose
lives were so bound up together, in what must be called a physical
unity, that they could be treated as parts of one common life. The
members of one kindred looked on themselves as one living whole, a
single animated mass of blood, flesh, and bones, of which no member
could be touched without all the members suffering. This point of view
is expressed in the Semitic tongues in many familiar forms of speech.
In case of homicide Arabian tribesmen do not say, &lsquo;The blood of M
or N has been spilt,&rsquo; naming the man; they say, &lsquo;Our blood
has been spilt.&rsquo; In Hebrew the phrase by which one claims kinship
is, &lsquo;I am your bone and your flesh.&rsquo; Both in Hebrew and in
Arabic &lsquo;flesh&rsquo; is synonymous with &lsquo;clan&rsquo; or
kindred group.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12344src" href=
"#xd21e12344" name="xd21e12344src">27</a> Similarly in India a Hindu
speaks of any member of his subcaste or clan as his <i>bhai</i> or
brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, in a religion based on kinship, where the god and his
worshippers are of one stock, the principle of sanctity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>and
that of kinship are identical. The sanctity of a kinsman&rsquo;s life
and the sanctity of the godhead are not two things but one; for
ultimately the only thing which is sacred is the common tribal life or
the common blood which is identified with the life. Whatever being
partakes in this life is holy, and its holiness may be described
indifferently as participation in the divine life and nature, or as
participation in the kindred blood.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;At a later period the conception is found
current that any food which two men partake of together, so that the
same substance enters into their flesh and blood, is enough to
establish some sacred unity of life between them; but in ancient times
this significance seems to be always attached to participation in the
flesh of a sacrosanct victim, and the solemn mystery of its death is
justified by the consideration that only in this way can the sacred
cement be procured which creates or keeps alive a living bond of union
between the worshippers and their god. This cement is nothing less than
the actual life of the sacred and kindred animal, which is conceived as
residing in its flesh, but especially in its blood, and so, in the
sacred meal, is actually distributed among all the participants, each
of whom incorporated a particle of it with his own individual
life.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12367src" href="#xd21e12367"

<h3 class="main">11. The blood-feud.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It thus appears that the sacrifice of the divine
animal which was the god of the tribe or clan, and the eating of its
flesh and drinking of its blood together, was the only tangible bond or
obligation on which such law and morality as existed in primitive
society was based. Those who participated in this sacrifice were
brothers and forbidden to shed each other&rsquo;s blood, because in so
doing they would have spilt the blood of the god impiously and
unlawfully; the only lawful occasion on which it could be shed being by
participation of all the clan or kinsmen in the sacrificial meal. All
other persons outside the clan were strangers or enemies, and no rights
or obligations existed in connection with them; the only restraint on
killing them being the fear that their kinsmen would take
blood-revenge, not solely on the murderer, but on any member of his
clan. A man&rsquo;s life was protected only by this readiness of his
clansmen to avenge him; if he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358"
href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>slew a fellow-kinsman, thus
shedding the blood of the god which flowed in the veins of every
member, or committed any other great impiety against the god, he was
outlawed, and henceforth there was no protection for his life except
such as he could afford himself by his own strength. This reflection
puts the importance of the blood-feud in primitive society in a clear
light. It was at that time really a beneficent institution, being the
only protection for human life; and its survival among such backward
races as the Path&#257;ns and Corsicans, long after the State has
undertaken the protection and avenging of life and the blood-feud has
become almost wholly useless and evil, is more easily understood.</p>

<h3 class="main">12. Taking food together and hospitality.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The original idea of the sacrificial meal was that the
kinsmen in concert partook of the body of the god, thereby renewing
their kinship with him and with each other. By analogy, however, the
tie thus formed was extended to the whole practice of eating together.
It has been seen how a stranger who partook of food with an Arab became
sacred and as a kinsman to his host and all the latter&rsquo;s clan for
such time as any part of the food might remain in his system, a period
which was conventionally taken as about three days. &ldquo;The Old
Testament records many cases where a covenant was sealed by the parties
eating and drinking together. In most of these the meal is sacrificial,
and the deity is taken in as a third party to the covenant. But in
Joshua i. 14 the Israelites enter into alliance with the Gibeonites by
taking of their victuals without consulting Jehovah. A formal league
confirmed by an oath follows, but by accepting the proffered food the
Israelites are already committed to the alliance.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12384src" href="#xd21e12384" name=
"xd21e12384src">30</a> From the belief in the strength and sanctity of
the tie formed by eating together the obligation of hospitality appears
to be derived. And this is one of the few moral ideas which are more
binding in primitive than in civilised society.</p>

<h3 class="main">14. The Hindu caste-feasts.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The intense importance thus attached to eating in
common on ceremonial occasions has a very familiar ring to any one
possessing some acquaintance with the Indian caste-system. The
resemblance of the <i>gotra</i> or clan and the subcaste to the Greek
<i>phratry</i> and <i>phule</i> and the Roman <i>gens</i> and
<i>curia</i> or tribe has been pointed out by M. Emile Senart in <i>Les
Castes dans l&rsquo;Inde</i>. The origin of the subcaste or group,
whose members eat together and intermarry, cannot be discussed here.
But it seems probable that the real bond which unites it is the
capacity of its members to join in the ceremonial feasts at marriages,
funerals, and the readmission of members temporarily excluded, which
are of a type closely resembling and seemingly derived from the
sacrificial meal. Before a wedding the ancestors of the family are
formally invited, and when the wedding-cakes are made they are offered
to the ancestors and then partaken of by all relatives of the family as
in the Roman <i>sacra</i>. In this case grain would take the place of
flesh as the sacrificial food among a people who no longer eat the
flesh of animals. Thus Sir J. G. Frazer states: &ldquo;At the close of
the rice harvest in the East Indian island of Buro each clan
(<i>fenna</i>) meets at a common sacramental meal, to which every
member of the clan is bound to contribute a little of the new rice.
This meal is called &lsquo;eating the soul of the rice,&rsquo; a name
which clearly indicates the sacramental character of the repast. Some
of the rice is also set apart and offered to the
spirits.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12450src" href="#xd21e12450"
name="xd21e12450src">32</a> Grain cooked with water is sacred food
among the Hindus. The bride and bridegroom worship Gauri, perhaps a
corn-goddess, and her son Ganesh, the god of prosperity and full
granaries. It has been suggested that yellow is the propitious Hindu
colour for weddings, because it is the colour of the corn.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12455src" href="#xd21e12455" name=
"xd21e12455src">33</a> At the wedding feast all the guests sit knee to
knee touching each other as a sign of their brotherhood. Sometimes the
bride eats with the men in token of her inclusion in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>brotherhood. In most castes the feast cannot
begin until all the guests have come, and every member of the subcaste
who is not under the ban of exclusion must be invited. If any
considerable number of the guests wilfully abstain from attending it is
an insult to the host and an implication that his own position is
doubtful. Other points of resemblance between the caste feast and the
sacrificial meal will be discussed elsewhere.</p>

<h3 class="main">15. Sacrifice of the camel.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sacrifice of the camel in Arabia, about the period
of the fourth century, is thus described: &ldquo;The camel chosen as
the victim is bound upon a rude altar of stones piled together, and
when the leader of the band has thrice led the worshippers round the
altar in a solemn procession accompanied with chants, he inflicts the
first wound while the last words of the hymn are still upon the lips of
the congregation, and in all haste drinks of the blood that gushes
forth. Forthwith the whole company fall on the victim with their
swords, hacking off pieces of the quivering flesh and devouring them
raw, with such wild haste that in the short interval between the rise
of the day-star, which marked the hour for the service to begin, and
the disappearance of its rays before the rising sun, the entire camel,
body and bones, skin, blood and entrails, is wholly
devoured.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12467src" href=
"#xd21e12467" name="xd21e12467src">34</a></p>
<p>In this case the camel was offered as a sacrifice to Venus or the
Morning Star, and it had to be devoured while the star was visible. But
it is clear that the camel itself had been originally revered, because
except for the sacrifice it was unlawful for the Arabs to kill the
camel otherwise than as a last resort to save themselves from
starvation. &ldquo;The ordinary sustenance of the Saracens was derived
from pillage or from hunting and from the milk of their herds. Only
when these supplies failed they fell back on the flesh of their camels,
one of which was slain for each clan or for each group which habitually
pitched their tents together&mdash;always a fraction of a
clan&mdash;and the flesh was hastily devoured by the kinsmen in
dog-like fashion, half raw and merely softened over the
fire.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12474src" href="#xd21e12474"
name="xd21e12474src">35</a> In Bhop&#257;l it is stated that a camel is
still sacrificed annually in perpetuation of the ancient rite. Hindus
who keep camels revere them like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361"
href="#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>other domestic animals. When
one of my tent-camels had broken its leg by a fall and had to be
killed, I asked the camelman, to whom the animal belonged, to shoot it;
but he positively refused, saying, &lsquo;How shall I kill him who
gives me my bread&rsquo;; and a Muhammadan orderly finally shot it.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The camel was devoured raw almost before the life had
left the body, so that its divine life and blood might be absorbed by
the worshippers. The obligation to devour the whole body perhaps rested
on the belief that its slaughter otherwise than as a sacrifice was
impious, and if any part of the body was left unconsumed the clan would
incur the guilt of murder. Afterwards, when more civilised stomachs
revolted against the practice of devouring the whole body, the bones
were buried or burnt, and it is suggested that our word bonfire comes
from bone-fire.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12486src" href="#xd21e12486"
name="xd21e12486src">36</a> Primitive usage required the presence of
every clansman, so that each might participate in shedding the sacred
blood. Neither the blood of the god nor of any of the kinsmen might be
spilt by private violence, but only by consent of the kindred and the
kindred god. Similarly in shedding the blood of a member of the kin all
the others were required to share the responsibility, and this was the
ancient Hebrew form of execution where the culprit was stoned by the
whole congregation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12492src" href=

<h3 class="main">17. Animal sacrifices in Greece.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">M. Salomon Reinach gives the following explanation of
Greek myths in connection with the sacrificial meal: &ldquo;The
primitive sacrifice of the god, usually accompanied by the eating of
the god in fellowship, was preserved in their religious rites, and when
its meaning had been forgotten numerous legends were invented to
account for it. In order to understand their origin it is necessary to
remember that the primitive worshippers masqueraded as the god and took
his name. As the object of the totem sacrifice is to make the
participants like the god and confer his divinity on them, the faithful
endeavoured to increase the resemblance by taking the name of the god
and covering themselves with the skins of animals of his species. Thus
the Athenian damsels celebrating the worship of the bear Artemis
dressed themselves in bear-skins and called themselves bears; the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span>Maenads who sacrificed the doe Penthea were clad
in doe-skins. Even in the later rites the devotees of Bacchus called
themselves Bacchantes. A whole series of legends can be interpreted as
semi-rationalistic explanations of the sacrificial meal. Actaeon was
really a great stag sacrificed by women devotees who called themselves
the great hind and the little hinds; he became the rash hunter who
surprised Artemis at her bath, and was transformed into a stag and
devoured by his own dogs. The dogs are a euphemism; in the early legend
they were the human devotees of the sacred stag who tore him to pieces
and devoured him with their bare teeth. These feasts of raw flesh
survived in the secret religious cults of Greece long after uncooked
meat had ceased to be consumed in ordinary life. Orpheus
(<i>ophreus</i>, the haughty), who appears in art with the skin of a
fox on his head, was originally a sacred fox devoured by the women of
the fox totem-clan; these women call themselves Bassarides in the
legend, and <i>bassareus</i> is one of the old names of the fox.
Zagreus is a son of Zeus and Persephone who transformed himself into a
bull to escape from the Titans, excited against him by Hera; the
Titans, worshippers of the divine bull, killed and ate him; Zagreus was
invoked in his worship as the &lsquo;good bull,&rsquo; and when Zagreus
by the grace of Zeus was reborn as Dionysus, the young god carried on
his forehead the horns which bore witness to his animal nature.
Hippolytus in the fable is the son of Theseus who repels the advances
of Phaedra, his stepmother, and was killed by his runaway horses
because Theseus, deceived by Phaedra, invoked the anger of a god upon
him. But Hippolytus in Greek means &lsquo;One torn to pieces by
horses.&rsquo; Hippolytus is himself a horse whom the worshippers of
the horse, calling themselves horses and disguised as such, tore to
pieces and devoured. Phaethon (The Shining One) is a son of Apollo, who
demands leave to drive the chariot of the sun, drives it badly, nearly
burns up the world, and finally falls and perishes in the sea. This
legend is the product of an old rite at Rhodes, the island of the sun,
where every year a white horse and a burning chariot were thrown into
the sea to help the sun, fatigued by his labours.&rdquo;<a class=

<h3 class="main">18. The Passover.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">M. Reinach points out that the Passover of the
Israelites was in its origin a similar sacrifice. A lamb or kid, the
first-fruit of the flocks, was eaten entire without the bones being
broken, the blood smeared on the doorway being an offering to the god.
The story connecting this sacrifice with the death of the first-born in
Egypt was of later origin, devised to account for it when the real
meaning had been forgotten.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12522src" href=
"#xd21e12522" name="xd21e12522src">39</a> The name Rachel<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12525src" href="#xd21e12525" name=
"xd21e12525src">40</a> means a ewe, and it would appear that the
children of Israel in the pastoral stage had the sheep for their totem
deity and supposed themselves to be descended from it, as the J&#257;ts
consider themselves to be descended from Siva, probably in his form of
Mah&#257;deo, the deified bull. As held in Canaan, the festival may
have been a relic of the former migratory life of the Israelites when
they tended flocks and regarded the sheep, or goat, as their most
important domestic animal. It may have been in memory of this wandering
life that the festival was accompanied by the eating of unleavened
bread, and the sacrifice was consumed with loins girded up and staffs
in their hands, as if in readiness for a journey. The Banj&#257;ras
retain in their marriage and other customs various reminiscences of
their former migratory life, as shown in the article on that caste. The
Gadarias of the Central Provinces worship a goddess called Dishai Devi,
who is represented by a stone platform just outside the sheep-pen. She
has thus probably developed from the deified sheep or goat, which
itself was formerly worshipped. On the eighth day of the fasts in Chait
and Kunw&#257;r the Gadarias offer the goddess a virgin she-goat. They
wash the goat&rsquo;s feet in water and rub turmeric on its feet and
head. It is given rice to eat and brought before the goddess, and water
is poured over its body; when the goat begins to shiver they think that
the goddess has accepted the offering, and cut its throat with a sickle
or knife. Then the animal is roasted whole and eaten in the veranda of
the house, nothing being thrown away but the bones. Only men may join
in this sacrifice, and not women. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364"

<h3 class="main">19. Sanctity of domestic animals.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thus it was a more or less general rule among several
races that the domestic animals were deified and held sacred, and were
slain only at a sacrifice. It followed that it was sinful to kill these
animals on any other occasion. It has already been seen that the Arabs
forbore to kill their worn-out camels for food except when driven to it
by hunger as a last resort. &ldquo;That it was once a capital offence
to kill an ox, both in Attica and the Peloponnesus, is attested by
Varro. So far as Athens is concerned, this statement seems to be drawn
from the legend that was told in connection with the annual sacrifice
at the Diipolia, where the victim was a bull and its death was followed
by a solemn inquiry as to who was responsible for the act. In this
trial everyone who had anything to do with the slaughter was called as
a party; the maidens who drew water to sharpen the axe and knife threw
the blame on the sharpeners, they put it on the man who handed the axe,
he on the man who struck down the victim, and he again on the one who
cut its throat, who finally fixed the responsibility on the knife,
which was accordingly found guilty of murder and cast into the
sea.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12540src" href="#xd21e12540"
name="xd21e12540src">41</a> &ldquo;At Tenedos the priest who offered a
bull-calf to Dionysus <i>anthroporraistes</i> was attacked with stones
and had to flee for his life; and at Corinth, in the annual sacrifice
of a goat to Hera Acraea, care was taken to shift the responsibility of
the death off the shoulders of the community by employing hirelings as
ministers. Even they did no more than hide the knife in such a way that
the goat, scraping with its feet, procured its own
death.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12548src" href="#xd21e12548"
name="xd21e12548src">42</a> &ldquo;Agatharchides, describing the
Troglodytes of East Africa, a primitive pastoral people in the
polyandrous state of society, tells us that their whole sustenance was
derived from their flocks and herds. When pasture abounded, after the
rainy season, they lived on milk mingled with blood (drawn apparently,
as in Arabia, from the living animal), and in the dry season they had
recourse to the flesh of aged or weakly beasts. Further, &lsquo;they
gave the name of parent to no human being, but only to the ox and cow,
the ram and ewe, from whom they had their nourishment.&rsquo; Among the
Caffres the cattle kraal is sacred; women may not enter it, and to
defile it is a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=

<h3 class="main">20. Sacrificial slaughter for food.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Gradually, however, as the reverence for animals
declined and the true level of their intelligence compared to that of
man came to be better appreciated, the sanctity attaching to their
lives no doubt grew weaker. Then it would become permissible to kill a
domestic animal privately and otherwise than by a joint sacrifice of
the clan; but the old custom of justifying the slaughter by offering it
to the god would still remain. &ldquo;At this stage,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e12571src" href="#xd21e12571" name="xd21e12571src">45</a> at
least among the Hebrews, the original sanctity of the life of domestic
animals is still recognised in a modified form, inasmuch as it is held
unlawful to use their flesh for food except in a sacrificial meal. But
this rule is not strict enough to prevent flesh from becoming a
familiar luxury. Sacrifices are multiplied on trivial occasions of
religious gladness or social festivity, and the rite of eating at the
sanctuary loses the character of an exceptional sacrament, and means no
more than that men are invited to feast and be merry at the table of
their god, or that no feast is complete in which the god has not his
share.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12574src" href="#xd21e12574"
name="xd21e12574src">46</a> This is the stage reached by the Hebrews in
the time of Samuel, as described by Professor Robertson Smith, and it
bears much resemblance to that of the lower Hindu castes and the Gonds
at the present time. They too, when they can afford to kill a goat or a
pig, cows being prohibited in deference to Hindu susceptibility, take
it to the shrine of some village deity and offer it there prior to
feasting on it with their friends. At intervals of a year or more many
of the lower castes sacrifice a goat to D&#363;lha Deo, the
bridegroom-god, and Th&#257;kur Deo, the corn-god, and eat the body as
a sacrificial meal within the house, burying the bones and other
remnants beneath the floor of the house.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12579src" href="#xd21e12579" name="xd21e12579src">47</a> Among
the K&#257;firs of the Hindu Kush, when a man wishes to become a Jast,
apparently a revered elder or senator, he must give a series of feasts
to the whole community, so expensive that many men utterly ruin
themselves in becoming Jast. The initiatory proceedings are sacrifices
of bulls and male goats to G&#299;sh, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb366" href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>war-god, at the
village shrine. The animals are examined with jealous eyes by the
spectators, to see that they come up to the prescribed standard of
excellence. After the sacrifice the meat is divided among the people,
who carry it to their homes. These special sacrifices at the shrine
recur at intervals; but the great slaughterings are at the
feast-giver&rsquo;s own house, where he entertains sometimes the Jast
exclusively and sometimes the whole tribe, as already
mentioned.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12586src" href="#xd21e12586"
name="xd21e12586src">48</a> Even in the latter case, however, after a
big distribution at the giver&rsquo;s house one or two goats are
offered to the war-god at his shrine; and while the animals are being
killed at the house offerings are made on a sacrificial fire, and as
each goat is slain a handful of its blood is taken and thrown on the
fire.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12593src" href="#xd21e12593" name=
"xd21e12593src">49</a> The K&#257;firs would therefore appear to be in
the stage when it is still usual to kill domestic animals as a
sacrifice to the god, but no longer obligatory.</p>

<h3 class="main">21. Animal fights.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Finally animals are recognised for what they are, all
sanctity ceases to attach to them, and they are killed for food in an
ordinary manner. Possibly, however, such customs as roasting an ox
whole, and the sports of bull-baiting and bull-fighting, may be relics
of the ancient sacrifice. Formerly the buffaloes sacrificed at the
shrine of the goddess Rankini or K&#257;li in Dalbh&#363;m
zam&#299;nd&#257;ri of Chota N&#257;gpur were made to fight. &ldquo;Two
male buffaloes are driven into a small enclosure and on a raised stage
adjoining and overlooking it the R&#257;ja and his suite take up their
position. After some ceremonies the R&#257;ja and his family priest
discharge arrows at the buffaloes, others follow their example, and the
tormented and enraged beasts fall to and gore each other whilst arrow
after arrow is discharged. When the animals are past doing very much
mischief, the people rush in and hack at them with battle-axes till
they are dead.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12604src" href=

<h3 class="main">22. The sacrificial method of killing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Muhammadans however cannot eat the flesh of an animal
unless its throat is cut and the blood allowed to flow before it dies.
At the time of cutting the throat a sacred text or invocation must be
repeated. It has been seen that in former times the blood of the animal
was offered to the god and scattered on the altar or collected in a pit
at its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>foot. It may be suggested that the method of
killing which still survives was that formerly practised in offering
the sacrifice, and that the necessity of allowing the blood to flow is
a relic of the blood offering. When it no longer became necessary to
sacrifice every animal at a shrine the sacrificial method of slaughter
and the invocation to the god might be retained as removing the impiety
of the act. At present it is said that unless an animal&rsquo;s blood
flows it is a <i>murda</i> or corpse, and hence not suitable for food.
But this idea may have grown up to account for the custom when its
original meaning had been forgotten. The Gonds, when sacrificing a
fowl, hold it over the sacred post or stone, which represents the god,
and let the blood drop upon it. And when sacrificing a pig they first
cut its tongue and let the blood fall upon the symbol of the god. In
Chhatt&#299;sgarh, when a Hindu is ill he makes a vow of the affected
limb to the god; then on recovering he goes to the temple, and cutting
this limb, lets the blood fall on to the symbol of the god as an
offering. Similarly the Sikhs are forbidden to eat flesh unless the
animal has been killed by <i>jatka</i> or cutting off the head with one
stroke, and the same rule is observed by some of the lower Hindu
castes. In Hindu sacrifices it is often customary that the head of the
animal should be made over to the officiating priest as his share, and
so in killing the animal he would naturally cut off its head. The above
rule may therefore be of the same character as the rite of
<i>hal&#257;l</i> among the Muhammadans, and here also the sacrificial
method of killing an animal may be retained to legalise its slaughter
after the sacrifice itself has fallen into desuetude. In Ber&#257;r
some time ago the Mullah or Muhammadan priest was a village servant and
the Hindus paid him dues. In return he was accustomed to kill the goats
and sheep which they wished to sacrifice at temples, or in their fields
to propitiate the deities presiding over them. He also killed animals
for the Khat&#299;k or mutton-butcher and the latter exposed them for
sale. The Mullah was entitled to the heart of the animal killed as his
perquisite and a fee of two pice. Some of the Mar&#257;thas were
unmindful of the ceremony, but in general they professed not to eat
flesh unless the sacred verse had been pronounced either by the Mullah
or some Muhammadan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368"
name="pb368">368</a>]</span>capable of rendering it <i>hal&#257;l</i>
or lawful to be eaten.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12632src" href=
"#xd21e12632" name="xd21e12632src">51</a> Hence it would appear that
the Hindus, unprovided by their own religion with any sacrificial mode
of legalising the slaughter of animals, adopted the ritual of a foreign
faith in order to make animal sacrifices acceptable to their own
deities. The belief that it is sinful to kill a domestic animal except
with some religious sanction is thus clearly shown in full force.</p>

<h3 class="main">23. Animal sacrifices in Indian ritual.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among high-caste Hindus also sacrifices, including the
killing of cows, were at one time legal. This is shown by several
legends,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12649src" href="#xd21e12649" name=
"xd21e12649src">52</a> and is also a historical fact. One of
Asoka&rsquo;s royal edicts prohibited at the capital the celebration of
animal sacrifices and merry-makings involving the use of meat, but in
the provinces apparently they continued to be lawful.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e12654src" href="#xd21e12654" name="xd21e12654src">53</a> This
indicates that prior to the rise of Buddhism such sacrifices had been
customary, and also that when a feast was to be given, involving the
consumption of meat, the animal was offered as a sacrifice. It is
noteworthy that Asoka&rsquo;s rules do not forbid the slaughter of
cows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12660src" href="#xd21e12660" name=
"xd21e12660src">54</a> In ancient times also the most important royal
sacrifice was that of the horse. The development of religious belief
and practice in connection with the killing of domestic animals has
thus proceeded on exactly opposite lines in India as compared with most
of the world. Domestic animals have become more instead of less sacred
and several of them cannot be killed at all. The reason usually given
to account for this is the belief in the transmigration of souls,
leading to the conclusion that the bodies of animals might be tenanted
by human souls. Probably also Buddhism left powerful traces of its
influence on the Hindu view of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369"
href="#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>sanctity of animal life even
after it had ceased to be the state religion. Perhaps the Br&#257;hmans
desired to make their faith more popular and took advantage of the
favourite reverence of all cultivators for the cow to exalt her into
one of their most powerful deities, and at the same time to extend the
local cult of Krishna, the divine cowherd, thus following exactly the
contrary course to that taken by Moses with the golden calf. Generally
the growth of political and national feeling has mainly operated to
limit the influence of the priesthood, and the spread of education and
development of reasoned criticism and discussion have softened the
strictness of religious observance and ritual. Both these factors have
been almost entirely wanting in Hindu society, and this perhaps
explains the continued sanctity attaching to the lives of domestic
animals as well as the unabated power of the caste system.</p>

definition of totemism is more or less in accord with that held by the
late Professor Robertson Smith, but is not generally accepted. The
exhaustive collection of totemic beliefs and customs contained in Sir
J. G. Frazer&rsquo;s <i>Totemism and Exogamy</i> affords, however,
substantial evidence in favour of it among tribes still in the hunting
stage in Australia, North America and Africa. The Indian form of
totemism is, in the writer&rsquo;s opinion, a later one, arising when
the totem animal has ceased to be the main source of life, and when the
clan come to think that they are descended from their totem animal and
that the spirits of their ancestors pass into the totem animal. When
this belief arises, they cease eating the totem as a mark of veneration
and respect, and abstain from killing or injuring it. Finally the totem
comes to be little more than a clan-name or family name, which serves
the purpose of preventing marriage between persons related through
males, who believe themselves to be descended from a common
ancestor.</p>

Grant-Duff, <i>History of the Mar&#257;thas</i>, vol. i. p. 27. Mr.
H&#299;ra L&#257;l notes that owing to the predominance of Muhammadans
in Ber&#257;r the practice of slaughtering all animals by the method of
<i>hal&#257;l</i> and the regular employment of the Mullah to pronounce
the sacred text before slaughter may have grown up for their
convenience. And, as in other instances, the Hindus may have simply
imitated the Muhammadans in regarding this method of slaughter as
necessary. This however scarcely seems to impair the force of the
argument if the Hindus actually refused to eat animals not killed by
<i>hal&#257;l</i>; they must in that case have attached some religious
significance or virtue to the rite, and the most probable significance
is perhaps that stated in the text. As Mr. H&#299;ra L&#257;l points
out, the Hindu sacred books provide an elaborate ritual for the
sacrifice of animals, but this may have fallen into abeyance with the
decline in the custom of eating meat.</p>

20,000 persons in the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r, and were
distributed over all Districts, except in the Jubbulpore division,
where they are scarcely found outside Mandla. Their place in the other
Districts of this division is taken by the Tameras. In Mandla the
Kas&#257;rs are represented by the inferior Bharewa group. The name of
the caste is derived from <i>k&#257;nsa</i>, a term now applied to
bell-metal. The kindred caste of Tameras take their name from
<i>t&#257;mba</i>, copper, but both castes work in this metal
indifferently, and in Saugor, Damoh and Jubbulpore no distinction
exists between the Kas&#257;rs and Tameras, the same caste being known
by both names. A similar confusion exists in northern India in the use
of the corresponding terms Kasera and Thathera.<a class="noteref" id=

Panch&#257;ls to make the vessels which they retail in their shops. And
the same is the case with the Mar&#257;tha and Deshkar subcastes in
N&#257;gpur. The Kas&#257;rs are a respectable caste, ranking next to
the Sun&#257;rs among the urban craftsmen.</p>

<p>According to a legend given by Mr. Sad&#257;sheo Jair&#257;m they
trace their origin from Dharamp&#257;l, the son of Sahasra Arjun or
Arjun of the Thousand Arms. Arjun was the greatgrandson of Ekshvaku,
who was born in the forests of Kalinga, from the union of a mare and a
snake. On this account the Kas&#257;rs of the Mar&#257;tha country say
that they all belong to the Ahihaya clan (<i>Ahi</i>, a snake; and
<i>Haya</i>, a mare). Arjun was killed by Parasur&#257;ma during the
slaughter of the Kshatriyas and Dharamp&#257;l&rsquo;s mother escaped
with three other pregnant women. According to another version all the
four women were the wives of the king of the Somvansi R&#257;jp&#363;ts
who stole the sacred cow K&#257;mdhenu. Their four sons on growing up
wished to avenge their father and prayed to the Goddess K&#257;li for
weapons. But unfortunately in their prayer, instead of saying
<i>b&#257;n</i>, arrow, they said <i>v&#257;n</i>, which means pot, and
hence brass pots were given to them instead of arrows. They set out to
sell the pots, but got involved in a quarrel with a R&#257;ja, who
killed three of them, but was defeated by the fourth, to whom he
afterwards gave his daughter and half his kingdom; and this hero became
the ancestor of the Kas&#257;rs. In some localities the Kas&#257;rs say
that Dharamp&#257;l, the R&#257;jp&#363;t founder of their caste, was
the ancestor of the Haihaya R&#257;jp&#363;t kings of Ratanpur; and it
is noticeable that the Thatheras of the United Provinces state that
their original home was a place called Ratanpur, in the
Deccan.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12722src" href="#xd21e12722" name=
"xd21e12722src">3</a> Both Ratanpur and Mandla, which are very old
towns, have important brass and bell-metal industries, their bell-metal
wares being especially well known on account of the brilliant polish
which is imparted to them. And the story of the Kas&#257;rs may well
indicate, as suggested by Mr. H&#299;ra L&#257;l, that Ratanpur was a
very early centre of the brass-working industry, from which it has
spread to other localities in this part of India.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Internal structure.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste have a number of subdivisions, mainly of a
territorial nature. Among these are the Mar&#257;tha Kas&#257;rs; the
Deshkar, who also belong to the Mar&#257;tha country; the Pardeshi or
foreigners, the Jh&#257;de or residents of the forest country of the
Central Provinces, and the Audhia or <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb371" href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>Ajudhiab&#257;si who
are immigrants from Oudh. Another subdivision, the Bharewas, are of a
distinctly lower status than the body of the caste, and have non-Aryan
customs, such as the eating of pork. They make the heavy brass
ornaments which the Gonds and other tribes wear on their legs, and are
probably an occupational offshoot from one of these tribes. In
Ch&#257;nda some of the Bharewas serve as grooms and are looked down
upon by the others. They have totemistic septs, named after animals and
plants, some of which are Gond words; and among them the bride goes to
the bridegroom&rsquo;s house to be married, which is a Gond custom. The
Bharewas may more properly be considered as a separate caste of lower
status. As previously stated, the Mar&#257;tha and Deshkar subcastes of
the Mar&#257;tha country no longer make vessels, but only keep them for
sale. One subcaste, the Ot&#257;ris, make vessels from moulds, while
the remainder cut and hammer into shape the imported sheets of brass.
Lastly comes a group comprising those members of the caste who are of
doubtful or illegitimate descent, and these are known either as
T&#257;kle (&lsquo;Thrown out&rsquo; in Mar&#257;thi), Bidur,
&lsquo;Bastard,&rsquo; or Laondi Bachcha, &lsquo;Issue of a kept
wife.&rsquo; In the Mar&#257;tha country the Kas&#257;rs, as already
seen, say that they all belong to one <i>gotra</i>, the Ahihaya. They
have, however, collections of families distinguished by different
surnames, and persons having the same surname are forbidden to marry.
In the northern Districts they have the usual collection of exogamous
septs, usually named after villages.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Social customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The marriages of first cousins are generally
forbidden, as well as of members of the same sept. Divorce and the
remarriage of widows are permitted. Devi or Bhaw&#257;ni is the
principal deity of the caste, as of so many Hindus. At her festival of
M&#257;ndo Am&#257;was or the day of the new moon of Ph&#257;gun
(February), every Kas&#257;r must return to the community of which he
is a member and celebrate the feast with them. And in default of this
he will be expelled from caste until the next Am&#257;was of
Ph&#257;gun comes round. They close their shops and worship the
implements of their trade on this day and also on the Pola day. The
Kas&#257;rs, as already stated, rank next to the Sun&#257;rs among the
artisan castes, and the Audhia Sun&#257;rs, who make ornaments of
bell-metal, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>form a connecting link between the two groups.
The social status of the Kas&#257;rs varies in different localities. In
some places Br&#257;hmans take water from them but not in others. Some
Kas&#257;rs now invest boys with the sacred thread at their weddings,
and thereafter it is regularly worn.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">4. Occupation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste make eating and drinking vessels, ornaments
and ornamental figures from brass, copper and bell-metal. Brass is the
metal most in favour for utensils, and it is usually imported in sheets
from Bombay, but in places it is manufactured from a mixture of three
parts of copper and two of zinc. This is considered the best brass,
though it is not so hard as the inferior kinds, in which the proportion
of zinc is increased. Ornaments of a grey colour, intended to resemble
silver, are made from a mixture of four parts of copper with five of
zinc. Bell-metal is an alloy of copper and tin, and in Ch&#257;nda is
made of four parts of copper to one part tin or tinfoil, the tin being
the more expensive metal. Bells of fairly good size and excellent tone
are moulded from this amalgam, and plates or saucers in which anything
acid in the way of food is to be kept are also made of it, since acids
do not corrode this metal as they do brass and copper. But bell-metal
vessels are fragile and sometimes break when dropped. They cannot also
be heated in the fire to clean them, and therefore cannot be lent to
persons outside the family; while brass vessels may be lent to friends
of other castes, and on being received back pollution is removed by
heating them in the fire or placing hot ashes in them. Br&#257;hmans
make a small fire of grass for this purpose and pass the vessels
through the flame. Copper cooking-pots are commonly used by Muhammadans
but not by Hindus, as they have to be coated with tin; the Hindus
consider that tin is an inferior metal whose application to copper
degrades the latter. Pots made of brass with a copper rim are called
&lsquo;Ganga Jamni&rsquo; after the confluence of the dark water of the
Jumna with the muddy stream of the Ganges, whose union they are
supposed to symbolise. Small figures of the deities or idols are also
made of brass, but some Kas&#257;rs will not attempt this work, because
they are afraid of the displeasure of the god in case the figure should
not be well or symmetrically shaped. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<b>Devad&#257;si</b>.&mdash;The caste of dancing-girls and prostitutes.
The name Kasbi is derived from the Arabic <i>kasab</i>, prostitution,
and signifies rather a profession than a caste. In India practically
all female dancers and singers are prostitutes, the Hindus being still
in that stage of the development of intersexual relations when it is
considered impossible that a woman should perform before the public and
yet retain her modesty. It is not so long that this idea has been
abandoned by Western nations, and the fashion of employing women actors
is perhaps not more than two or three centuries old in England. The
gradual disappearance of the distinctive influence of sex in the public
and social conduct of women is presumably a sign of advancing
civilisation, and is greatest in the West, the old standards retaining
more and more vitality as we proceed Eastward. Among the Anglo-Saxon
races women are almost entirely emancipated from any handicap due to
their sex, and direct their lives with the same freedom and
independence as men. Among the Latin races many people still object to
girls walking out alone in towns, and in Italy the number of women to
be seen in the streets is so small that it must be considered improper
for a young and respectable woman to go about alone. Here also survives
the <i lang="fr">mariage de <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href=
"#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>convenance</i> or arrangement of
matches by the parents; the underlying reason for this custom, which
also partly accounts for the institution of infant-marriage, appears to
be that it is not considered safe to permit a young girl to frequent
the society of unmarried men with sufficient freedom to be able to make
her own choice. And, finally, on arrival in Egypt and Turkey we find
the seclusion of women still practised, and only now beginning to
weaken before the influence of Western ideas. But again in the lowest
scale of civilisation, among the Gonds and other primitive tribes,
women are found to enjoy great freedom of social intercourse. This is
partly no doubt because their lives are too hard and rude to permit of
any seclusion of women, but also partly because they do not yet
consider it an obligatory feature of the institution of marriage that a
girl should enter upon it in the condition of a virgin.</p>

Devad&#257;sis or &lsquo;Hand-maidens of the gods.&rsquo; They are thus
described by Marco Polo: &ldquo;In this country,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;there are certain abbeys in which are gods and goddesses, and
here fathers and mothers often consecrate their daughters to the
service of the deity. When the priests desire to feast their god they
send for those damsels, who serve the god with meats and other goods,
and then sing and dance before him for about as long as a great baron
would be eating his dinner. Then they say that the god has devoured the

inconsistences of the Hindu religion that though their profession is
repeatedly and vehemently condemned by the Sh&#257;stras it has always
received the countenance of the church. The rise of the caste and its
euphemistic name seem both of them to date from the ninth and tenth
centuries of our era, during which much activity prevailed in southern
India in the matter of building temples and elaborating the services
held in them. The dancing-girls&rsquo; duties then as now were to fan
the idol with <i>chamaras</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375"
href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>or Thibetan ox-tails, to hold
the sacred light called Kumbarti and to sing and dance before the god
when he was carried in procession. Inscriptions show that in
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1004 the great temple of the Chola king
Rajar&#257;ja at Tanjore had attached to it 400 women of the temple who
lived in free quarters in the surrounding streets, and were given a
grant of land from the endowment. Other temples had similar
arrangements. At the beginning of last century there were a hundred
dancing-girls attached to the temple at Conjeeveram, and at Madura,
Conjeeveram and Tanjore there are still numbers of them who receive
allowances from the endowments of the big temples at those places. In
former days the profession was countenanced not only by the church but
by the state. Abdur Raz&#257;k, a Turkish ambassador to the court of
Vijayanagar in the fifteenth century, describes women of this class as
living in state-controlled institutions, the revenue of which went
towards the upkeep of the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dedication of girls to temples and religious prostitution was by
no means confined to India but is a common feature of ancient
civilisation. The subject has been mentioned by Dr. Westermarck in
<i>The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas</i>, and fully
discussed by Sir James Frazer in <i>Attis, Adonis, Osiris</i>. The best
known and most peculiar instance is that of the temple of Istar in
Babylonia. &ldquo;Herodotus says that every woman born in that country
was obliged once in her life to go and sit down in the precinct of
Aphrodite and there consort with a stranger. A woman who had once taken
her seat was not allowed to return home till one of the strangers threw
a silver coin into her lap and took her with him beyond the holy
ground. The silver coin could not be refused because, since once
thrown, it was sacred. The woman went with the first man who threw her
money, rejecting no one. When she had gone with him and so satisfied
the goddess, she returned home, and from that time forth no gift,
however great, would prevail with her. In the Canaanitish cults there
were women called <i>ked&#275;sh&#333;th</i>, who were consecrated to
the deity with whose temple they were associated, and who at the same
time acted as prostitutes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12866src"
href="#xd21e12866" name="xd21e12866src">3</a> Other instances are given
from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span>Africa, Egypt and ancient Greece. The principal
explanation of these practices was that the act of intercourse,
according to the principle of sympathetic magic, produced fertility,
usually of the crops, though in the Babylonian case, Dr. Westermarck
thinks, of the woman herself. Several instances have been recorded of
people who perform the sexual act as a preliminary or accompaniment to
sowing the crops,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12874src" href=
"#xd21e12874" name="xd21e12874src">4</a> and there seems little doubt
that this explanation is correct. A secondary idea of religious
prostitution may have been to afford to the god the same sexual
pleasures as delighted an earthly king. Thus the Skanda Pur&#257;na
relates that K&#257;rtikeya, the Hindu god of war, was sent by his
father to frustrate the sacrifice of Daksha, and at the instigation of
the latter was delayed on his way by beautiful damsels, who entertained
him with song and dance. Hence it is the practice still for
dancing-girls who serve in the pagodas to be betrothed and married to
him, after which they may prostitute themselves but cannot marry a
man.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12881src" href="#xd21e12881" name=
"xd21e12881src">5</a> Similarly the Murlis or dancing-girls in
Mar&#257;tha temples are married to Khandoba, the Mar&#257;tha god of
war. Sometimes the practice of prostitution might begin by the priests
of the temple as representatives of the god having intercourse with the
women. This is stated to have been the custom at the temple of
Jagann&#257;th in Orissa, where the officiating Br&#257;hmans had
adulterous connection with the women who danced and sang before the
god.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12887src" href="#xd21e12887" name=

<h3 class="main">3. Music and dancing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Both music and dancing, like others of the arts,
probably originated as part of a religious or magical service or
ritual, and hence would come to be practised by the women attached to
temples. And it would soon be realised what potent attractions these
arts possessed when displayed by women, and in course of time they
would be valued as accomplishments in themselves, and either acquired
independently by other courtesans or divorced from a sole application
to religious ritual. In this manner music, singing and dancing may have
grown to be considered as the regular attractions of the courtesan and
hence immoral in themselves, and not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb377" href="#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>suitable for display
by respectable women. The Emperor Sh&#257;h Jah&#257;n is said to have
delighted in the performances of the Taw&#257;if or Muhammadan singing
and dancing girls, who at that time lived in bands and occupied
mansions as large as palaces.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12903src"
href="#xd21e12903" name="xd21e12903src">7</a> Aur&#257;ngzeb ordered
them all to be married or banished from his dominions, but they did not
submit without a protest; and one morning as the Emperor was going to
the mosque he saw a vast crowd of mourners marching in file behind a
bier, and filling the air with screams and lamentations. He asked what
it meant, and was told that they were going to bury Music; their mother
had been executed, and they were weeping over her loss. &lsquo;Bury her
deep,&rsquo; the Emperor cried, &lsquo;she must never rise
again.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">4. Education of courtesans.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The possession of these attractions naturally gave the
courtesan an advantage over ordinary women who lacked them, and her
society was much sought after, as shown in the following description of
a native court:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12914src" href="#xd21e12914"
name="xd21e12914src">8</a> &ldquo;Nor is the courtesan excluded, she of
the smart saying, famed for the much-valued cleverness which is gained
in &lsquo;the world,&rsquo; who when the learned fail is ever ready to
cut the Gordian knot of solemn question with the sharp blade of her
repartee, for&mdash;The sight of foreign lands; the possession of a
Pandit for a friend; a <i>courtesan</i>; access to the royal court;
patient study of the Sh&#257;stras; the roots of cleverness are these
five.&rdquo; Mr. Crooke also remarks on the tolerance extended to this
class of women: &ldquo;The curious point about Indian prostitutes is
the tolerance with which they are received into even respectable
houses, and the absence of that strong social disfavour in which this
class is held in European countries. This feeling has prevailed for a
lengthened period. We read in the Buddhist histories of Ambap&#257;ta,
the famous courtesan, and the price of her favours fixed at two
thousand <i>masurans</i>. The same feeling appears in the folk-tales
and early records of Indian courts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12926src" href="#xd21e12926" name="xd21e12926src">9</a> It may be
remarked, however, that the social ostracism of such women has not
always been the rule in Europe, while as regards <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span>conjugal morality Indian society would probably
appear to great advantage beside that of Europe in the Middle Ages. But
when the courtesan is alone possessed of the feminine accomplishments,
and also sees much of society and can converse with point and
intelligence on public affairs, her company must necessarily be more
attractive than that of the women of the family, secluded and
uneducated, and able to talk about nothing but the petty details of
household management. Education so far as women were concerned was to a
large extent confined to courtesans, who were taught all the feminine
attainments on account of the large return to be obtained in the
practice of their profession. This is well brought out in the following
passage from a Hindu work in which the mother speaks:<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e12935src" href="#xd21e12935" name="xd21e12935src">10</a>
&ldquo;Worthy Sir, this daughter of mine would make it appear that I am
to blame, but indeed I have done my duty, and have carefully prepared
her for that profession for which by birth she was intended. From
earliest childhood I have bestowed the greatest care upon her, doing
everything in my power to promote her health and beauty. As soon as she
was old enough I had her carefully instructed in the arts of dancing,
acting, playing on musical instruments, singing, painting, preparing
perfumes and flowers, in writing and conversation, and even to some
extent in grammar, logic and philosophy. She was taught to play various
games with skill and dexterity, how to dress well and show herself off
to the greatest advantage in public; yet after all the time, trouble
and money which I have spent upon her, just when I was beginning to
reap the fruit of my labours, the ungrateful girl has fallen in love
with a stranger, a young Br&#257;hman without property, and wishes to
marry him and give up her profession (of a prostitute), notwithstanding
all my entreaties and representations of the poverty and distress to
which all her family will be reduced if she persists in her purpose;
and because I oppose this marriage, she declares that she will renounce
the world and become a devotee.&rdquo; Similarly the education of
another dancing-girl is thus described:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12944src" href="#xd21e12944" name="xd21e12944src">11</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>&ldquo;Gauhar J&#257;n did her duty by the child
according to her lights. She engaged the best &lsquo;Gawayyas&rsquo; to
teach her music, the best &lsquo;Kathaks&rsquo; to teach her dancing,
the best &lsquo;Ust&#257;ds&rsquo; to teach her elocution and
deportment, and the best of Munshis to ground her in Urdu and Persian
<i>belles lettres</i>; so that when Imtiaz&#257;n reached her fifteenth
year her accomplishments were noised abroad in the baz&#257;r.&rdquo;
It is still said to be the custom for the Hindus in large towns, as
among the Greeks of the time of Pericles, to frequent the society of
courtesans for the charm of their witty and pointed conversation.
Betel-nut is provided at such receptions, and at the time of departure
each person is expected to deposit a rupee in the tray. Of course it is
in no way meant to assert that the custom is at all generally prevalent
among educated men, as this would be quite untrue.</p>

<p>The association of all feminine charms and intellectual attainments
with public women led to the belief that they were incompatible with
feminine modesty; and this was even extended to certain ornamental
articles of clothing such as shoes. The Abb&eacute; Dubois
remarks:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12962src" href="#xd21e12962" name=
"xd21e12962src">12</a> &ldquo;The courtesans are the only women in
India who enjoy the privilege of learning to read, to dance and to
sing. A well-bred respectable woman would for this reason blush to
acquire any one of these accomplishments.&rdquo; Buchanan
says:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12967src" href="#xd21e12967" name=
"xd21e12967src">13</a> &ldquo;The higher classes of Hindu women
consider every approach to wearing shoes as quite indecent; so that
their use is confined to Muhammadans, camp trulls and Europeans, and
most of the Muhammadans have adopted the Hindu notion on this subject;
women of low rank wear sandals.&rdquo; And again:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12972src" href="#xd21e12972" name="xd21e12972src">14</a> &ldquo;A
woman who appears clean in public on ordinary occasions may pretty
confidently be taken for a prostitute; such care of her person would
indeed be considered by her husband as totally incompatible with
modesty.&rdquo; And as regards accomplishments:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12977src" href="#xd21e12977" name="xd21e12977src">15</a>
&ldquo;It is considered very disgraceful for a modest woman to sing or
play on any musical instrument; the only time when such a practice is
permitted is among the Muhammadans at the Muharram, when women are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380</a>]</span>allowed to join in the praises of F&#257;tima
and her son.&rdquo; And a current saying is: &ldquo;A woman who sings
in the house as she goes about her work and one who is fond of music
can never be a Sati&rdquo;; a term which is here used as an equivalent
for a virtuous woman. Buchanan wrote a hundred years ago, and things
have no doubt improved since his time, but this feeling appears to be
principally responsible for much of the prejudice against female
education, which has hitherto been so strong even among the literate
classes of Hindus; and is only now beginning to break down as the
highly cultivated young men of the present day have learned to
appreciate and demand a greater measure of intelligence from their
wives.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Caste customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the better class of Kasbis a certain caste
feeling and organisation exists. When a girl attains adolescence her
mother makes a bargain with some rich man to be her first consort. Oil
and turmeric are rubbed on her body for five days as in the case of a
bride. A feast is given to the caste and the girl is married to a
dagger, walking seven times round the sacred post with it. Her human
consort then marks her forehead with vermilion and covers her head with
her head-cloth seven times. In the evening she goes to live with him
for as long as he likes to maintain her, and afterwards takes up the
practice of her profession. In this case it is necessary that the man
should be an outsider and not a member of the Kasbi caste, because the
quasi-marriage is the formal commencement on the part of the woman of
her hereditary trade. As already seen, the feeling of shame and
degradation attaching to this profession in Europe appears to be
somewhat attenuated in India, and it is counterbalanced by that
acquiescence in and attachment to the caste-calling which is the
principal feature of Hindu society. And no doubt the life of the
dancing-girl has, at any rate during youth, its attractions as compared
with that of a respectable married woman. Tavernier tells the
story<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12989src" href="#xd21e12989" name=
"xd21e12989src">16</a> of a Sh&#257;h of Persia who, desiring to punish
a dancing-girl for having boxed the ears of one of her companions
within his hearing (it being clearly not the effect of the operation on
the patient which annoyed his majesty) made an order that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>she
should be married. And a more curious instance still is the following
from a recent review:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12996src" href=
"#xd21e12996" name="xd21e12996src">17</a> &ldquo;The natives of India
are by instinct and custom the most conservative race in the world.
When I was stationed at Aurang&#257;b&#257;d&mdash;fifty years ago it
is true, but that is but a week in regard to this question&mdash;a case
occurred within my own knowledge which shows the strength of hereditary
feeling. An elderly wealthy native adopted two baby girls, whose mother
and family had died during a local famine. The children grew up with
his own girls and were in all respects satisfactory, and apparently
quite happy until they arrived at the usual age for marriage. They then
asked to see their papa by adoption, and said to him, &lsquo;We are
very grateful to you for your care of us, but we are now grown up. We
are told our mother was a Kasbi (prostitute), and we must insist on our
rights, go out into the world, and do as our mother
did.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the fifth or seventh month of the first pregnancy
of a Kasbi woman 108 fried wafers of flour and sugar, known as
<i>g&#363;jahs</i>, are prepared, and are eaten by her as well as
distributed to friends and relatives who are invited to the house.
After this they in return prepare similar wafers and send them to the
pregnant woman. Some little time before the birth the mother washes her
head with gram flour, puts on new clothes and jewels, and invites all
her friends to the house, feasting them with rice boiled in milk, cakes
and sweetmeats.</p>

<h3 class="main">7. Different classes of women.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though the better-class Kasbis appear to have a sort
of caste union, this is naturally quite indefinite, inasmuch as
marriage, at present the essential bond of caste-organisation, is
absent. The sons of Kasbis take up any profession that they choose; and
many of them marry and live respectably with their wives. Others become
musicians and assist at the performances of the dancing-girls, as the
Bhadua who beats the cymbals and sings in chorus and also acts as a
pimp, and the S&#257;rangia, one who performs on the
<i>s&#257;rangi</i> or fiddle. The girls themselves are of different
classes, as the Kasbi or G&#257;yan who are Hindus, the Taw&#257;if who
are Muhammadans, and the Bogam or Telugu dancing-girls. Gond women are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>known as Deogarhni, and are supposed to have
come from Deogarh in Chhindw&#257;ra, formerly the headquarters of a
Gond dynasty. The S&#257;rangias or fiddlers are now a separate caste.
In the northern Districts the dancing-girls are usually women of the
Beria caste and are known as Berni. After the spring harvest the
village headman hires one or two of these girls, who dance and do
acrobatic feats by torchlight. They will continue all through the
night, stimulated by draughts of liquor, and it is said that one woman
will drink two or three bottles of the country spirit. The young men of
the village beat the drum to accompany her dancing, and take turns to
see how long they can go on doing so without breaking down. After the
performance each cultivator gives the woman one or two pice (farthings)
and the headman gives her a rupee. Such a celebration is known as Rai,
and is distinctive of Bundelkhand.</p>
<p>In Bengal this class of women often become religious mendicants and
join the Vaishnava or Bair&#257;gi community, as stated by Sir H.
Risley:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13025src" href="#xd21e13025" name=
"xd21e13025src">18</a> &ldquo;The mendicant members of the Vaishnava
community are of evil repute, their ranks being recruited by those who
have no relatives, by widows, by individuals too idle or depraved to
lead a steady working life, and by prostitutes. Vaishnavi, or Baishtabi
according to the vulgar pronunciation, has come to mean a courtesan. A
few undoubtedly join from sincere and worthy motives, but their numbers
are too small to produce any appreciable effect on the behaviour of
their comrades. The habits of these beggars are very unsettled. They
wander from village to village and from one <i>akh&#257;ra</i>
(monastery) to another, fleecing the frugal and industrious peasantry
on the plea of religion, and singing songs in praise of Hari beneath
the village tree or shrine. Members of both sexes smoke Indian hemp
(<i>g&#257;nja</i>), and although living as brothers and sisters are
notorious for licentiousness. There is every reason for suspecting that
infanticide is common, as children are never seen. In the course of
their wanderings they entice away unmarried girls, widows, and even
married women on the pretence of visiting Sri Kshetra (Jagann&#257;th)
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span>Brind&#257;ban or Ben&#257;res, for which reason
they are shunned by all respectable natives, who gladly give charity to
be rid of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In large towns prostitutes belong to all castes. An old list
obtained by Rai Bah&#257;dur H&#299;ra L&#257;l of registered
prostitutes in Jubbulpore showed the following numbers of different
castes: Barai six, Dh&#299;mar four, and Nai, Khang&#257;r,
K&#257;chhi, Gond, Teli, Br&#257;hman, R&#257;jp&#363;t and Bania three
each. Each woman usually has one or two girls in training if she can
obtain them, with a view to support herself by their earnings in the
same method of livelihood when her own attractions have waned.
Fatherless and orphan girls run a risk of falling into this mode of
life, partly because their marriages cannot conveniently be arranged,
and also from the absence of strict paternal supervision. For it is to
be feared that a girl who is allowed to run about at her will in the
baz&#257;r has little chance of retaining her chastity even up to the
period of her arrival at adolescence. This is no doubt one of the
principal considerations in favour of early marriage. The caste-people
often subscribe for the marriage of a girl who is left without support,
and it is said that in former times an unmarried orphan girl might go
and sit <i>dharna</i>, or starving herself, at the king&rsquo;s gate
until he arranged for her wedding. Formerly the practice of obtaining
young girls was carried on to a much greater extent than at present.
Malcolm remarks:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13043src" href=
"#xd21e13043" name="xd21e13043src">19</a> &ldquo;Slavery in M&#257;lwa
and the adjoining provinces is chiefly limited to females; but there is
perhaps no part of India where there are so many slaves of this sex.
The dancing-girls are all purchased, when young, by the Nakins or heads
of the different sets or companies, who often lay out large sums in
these speculations, obtaining advances from the bankers on interest
like other classes.&rdquo; But the attractions of the profession and
the numbers of those who engage in it have now largely declined.</p>

<h3 class="main">8. Dancing and singing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The better class of Kasbi women, when seen in public,
are conspicuous by their wealth of jewellery and their shoes of patent
leather or other good material. Women of other castes do not commonly
wear shoes in the streets. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384"
href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span>Kasbis are always well and
completely clothed, and it has been noticed elsewhere that the Indian
courtesan is more modestly dressed than most women. No doubt in this
matter she knows her business. A well-to-do dancing-girl has a dress of
coloured muslin or gauze trimmed with tinsel lace, with a short waist,
long straight sleeves, and skirts which reach a little below the knee,
a shawl falling from the head over the shoulders and wrapped round the
body, and a pair of tight satin trousers, reaching to the ankles. The
feet are bare, and strings of small bells are tied round them. They
usually dance and sing to the accompaniment of the <i>tabla</i>,
<i>s&#257;rangi</i> and <i>maj&#299;ra</i>. The <i>tabla</i> or drum is
made of two half-bowls&mdash;one brass or clay for the bass, and the
other of wood for the treble. They are covered with goat-skin and
played together. The <i>s&#257;rangi</i> is a fiddle. The
<i>maj&#299;ra</i> (cymbals) consist of two metallic cups slung
together and used for beating time. Before a dancing-girl begins her
performance she often invokes the aid of S&#257;raswati, the goddess of
music. She then pulls her ear as a sign of remembrance of T&#257;nsen,
India&rsquo;s greatest musician, and a confession to his spirit of the
imperfection of her own sense of music. The movements of the feet are
accompanied by a continual opening and closing of henna-dyed hands; and
at intervals the girl kneels at the feet of one or other of the
audience. On the festival of Basant Panchmi or the commencement of
spring these girls worship their dancing-dress and musical instruments
with offerings of rice, flowers and a cocoanut.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Katia</b>, <b>Katwa</b>, <b>Katua</b>.&mdash;An
occupational caste of cotton-spinners and village watchmen belonging to
the Satp&#363;ra Districts and the Nerbudda valley. In 1911 they
numbered 41,000 persons and were returned mainly from the
Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d, Seoni and Chhindw&#257;ra Districts. The caste
is almost confined to the Central Provinces. The name is derived from
the Hindi <i>k&#257;tna</i>, to spin thread, and the Katias are an
occupational group probably recruited from the Mah&#257;rs and Koris.
They have a tradition, Mr. Crooke states,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13092src" href="#xd21e13092" name="xd21e13092src">1</a> that they
were originally Bais R&#257;jp&#363;ts, whose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span>ancestors, having been imprisoned for resistance
to authority, were released on the promise that they would follow a
woman&rsquo;s occupation of spinning thread. In the Central Provinces
they are sometimes called Renhta R&#257;jp&#363;ts or Knights of the
Spinning Wheel. The tradition of R&#257;jp&#363;t descent need not of
course be taken seriously. The drudgery of spinning thread was
naturally imposed on any widow in the household, and hence the saying,
&lsquo;It is always moving, like a widow&rsquo;s
spinning-wheel.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13100src" href=

<h3 class="main">2. Subcastes and exogamous groups.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Katias have several subcastes, with names
generally derived from places in the Central Provinces, as Path&#257;ri
from a village in the Chhindw&#257;ra District, Mandilw&#257;r from
Mandla, Gadhew&#257;l from Garha, near Jubbulpore, and so on. The
Dulbuha group consist of those who were formerly palanquin-bearers
(from <i>doli</i>, a litter). They have also more than fifty exogamous
septs, with names of the usual low-caste type, derived from places,
animals or plants, or natural objects. Some of the septs are
subdivided. Thus the N&#257;gotia sept, named after the cobra, is split
up into the N&#257;gotia, Dirat<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13114src"
href="#xd21e13114" name="xd21e13114src">3</a> N&#257;g,
Bh&#257;rowar<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13117src" href="#xd21e13117"
name="xd21e13117src">4</a> N&#257;g, Kosam Karia and
Haz&#257;ri<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13120src" href="#xd21e13120"
name="xd21e13120src">5</a> N&#257;g groups. It is said that the
different groups do not intermarry; but it is probable that they do, as
otherwise there seems to be no object in the subdivision. The Kosam
Karias worship a cobra at their weddings, but not the others. The
Singhotia sept, from <i>singh</i>, a horn, is divided into the Bakaria
(goat) and Gh&#257;gar-bharia (one who fills an earthen vessel)
subsepts. The Bakarias offer goats to their gods; and the
Gh&#257;gar-bharias on the Akti<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13127src"
href="#xd21e13127" name="xd21e13127src">6</a> festival, just before the
breaking of the rains, fill an earthen vessel and worship it, and
consider it sacred for that day. Next day it is brought into ordinary
use. The Dongaria sept, from <i>dongar</i>, a hill, revere the
<i>chheola</i> tree.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13136src" href=
"#xd21e13136" name="xd21e13136src">7</a> They choose any tree of this
species outside the village, and say that it is placed on a hill, and
go and worship it once a year. In this case it would appear that a hill
was first venerated as an animate being and the ancestor of the sept.
When hills were no longer so regarded, a <i>chheola</i> tree growing on
a hill <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=
"pb386">386</a>]</span>was substituted; and now the tree only is
revered, probably a good deal for form&rsquo;s sake, and so far as the
hill is concerned, the mere pretence that it is growing on a hill is
sufficient.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Marriage customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A man must not take a wife from his own sept nor from
that of his mother or grandmother. Girls are commonly married between
eight and twelve years of age; and a customary payment of Rs. 9 is made
to the father of the bride, double this amount being given by a
widower. An unmarried girl seduced by a man of the caste is united to
him by the ceremony used for a widow, and a fine is imposed on her
parents; if she goes wrong with an outsider she is expelled from the
community. In the marriage ceremony the customary ritual of the
northern Districts is followed,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13150src"
href="#xd21e13150" name="xd21e13150src">8</a> and the binding portion
of it consists in the bride and bridegroom walking seven times around
the <i>bh&#257;nwar</i> or sacred pole. While she does this it is
essential that the bride should wear a string of black beads round her
neck and brass anklets on her feet. After the ceremony the
bride&rsquo;s mother and other women dance before the company. Whether
the bride be a child or young woman she always returns home after a
stay of a few days at her husband&rsquo;s house, and at her subsequent
final departure the Gauna or going-away ceremony is performed. If the
bridegroom dies after the wedding and before the Gauna, his younger
brother or cousin or anybody else may come and take away the bride
after performing this ceremony, and she will be considered as fully
married to him. She is known as a Gonhyai wife, as distinguished from a
By&#257;hta or one married in the ordinary manner, and a Karta or widow
married a second time. But the children of all three inherit equally. A
widow may marry again, and take any one she pleases for her second
husband. Widow-marriages must not be celebrated in the rainy months of
Shr&#257;wan, Bh&#257;don and Kunw&#257;r. No music is allowed at them,
and the husband must present a fee of a rupee and a cocoanut to the
m&#257;lguz&#257;r (proprietor) of the village and four annas to the
kotw&#257;r or watchman. A bachelor who is to marry a widow first goes
through a formal ceremony with a cotton plant. Divorce is permitted for
mutual disagreement. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387"
name="pb387">387</a>]</span>The couple stand before the caste committee
and each takes a stick, breaks it in two halves, and throws them apart,
saying, &ldquo;I have no further connection with my husband (or wife),
and I break my marriage with him (or her) as I break this
stick.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">4. Funeral rites.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dead may be either buried or burnt, as convenient,
and mourning is always observed for three days. Before the corpse is
removed a new earthen pot filled with rice is placed on the bier. The
chief mourner raises it, and addressing the deceased informs him that
after a certain period he will be united to the sainted dead, and until
that day his spirit should abide happily in the pot and not trouble his
family. The mouth of the pot is then covered, and after the funeral the
mourners take it home with them. When the day appointed for the final
ceremony has come, a miniature platform is made from sticks tied
together, and garlands and offerings of cakes are hung on to it. A
small heap of rice is made on the platform, and just above it a clove
is suspended from a thread. Songs are sung, and the principal relative
opens the pot in which the spirit of the deceased has been enclosed.
The spirit is called upon to join the sacred company of the dead, and
the party continue to sing and to adjure it with all their force. The
thread from which the clove is suspended begins to swing backwards and
forwards over the rice; and a pig and two or three chickens are crushed
to death as offerings to the soul of the deceased. Finally the clove
touches the rice, and it is believed that the spirit of the dead man
has departed to join the sainted dead. The Katias consider that after
this he requires nothing more from the living, and so they do not make
the annual offerings to the souls of the departed.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Social rules.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste sometimes employ a Br&#257;hman for the
marriage ceremony; but generally his services are limited to fixing an
auspicious date, and the functions of a priest are undertaken by
members of the family. They invite a Br&#257;hman to give a name to a
boy, and call him by this name. They think that if they changed the
name they would not be able to get a wife for the child. They will eat
any kind of flesh, including pork and fowls, but they are not
considered to be impure. They are generally illiterate, and dirty in
appearance. Unmarried girls wear glass bangles on both hands, but
married <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>women wear metal bracelets on the right hand and
glass on the left. Girls are twice tattooed: first in childhood, and a
second time after marriage. The proper avocations of the Katias were
the spinning of cotton thread and the weaving of the finer kinds of
cloth; but most of them have had to abandon their ancestral calling
from want of custom, and they are now either village watchmen or
cultivators and labourers. A few of them own villages. The Katias think
themselves rather knowing; but this opinion is not shared by their
neighbours, who say ironically of them, &ldquo;A Katia is eight times
as wise as an ordinary man, and a K&#257;yasth thirteen times. Any one
who pretends to be wiser than these must be an idiot.&rdquo;

<h3 class="main">1. Tribal legend.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Kawar</b>, <i>Kanwar</i>, <b>Kaur</b> (honorific
title, Sird&#257;r).&mdash;A primitive tribe living in the hills of the
Chhatt&#299;sgarh Districts north of the Mah&#257;nadi. The
hill-country comprised in the northern zam&#299;nd&#257;ri estates of
Bil&#257;spur and the adjoining Feudatory States of Jashpur, Udaipur,
Sarg&#363;ja, Ch&#257;ng Bhak&#257;r and Korea is the home of the
Kawars, and is sometimes known after them as the Kamr&#257;n. Eight of
the Bil&#257;spur zam&#299;nd&#257;rs are of the Kawar tribe. The total
numbers of the tribe are nearly 200,000, practically all of whom belong
to the Central Provinces. In Bil&#257;spur the name is always
pronounced with a nasal as Kanwar. The Kawars trace their origin from
the Kauravas of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, who were defeated by the
P&#257;ndavas at the great battle of Hastin&#257;pur. They say that
only two pregnant women survived and fled to the hills of Central
India, where they took refuge in the houses of a R&#257;wat (grazier)
and a Dhobi (washerman) respectively, and the boy and girl children who
were born to them became the ancestors of the Kawar tribe.
Consequently, the Kawars will take food from the hands of R&#257;wats,
especially those of the Kauria subcaste, who are in all probability
descended from Kawars. And when a Kawar <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb390" href="#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>is put out of caste
for having maggots in a wound, a Dhobi is always employed to readmit
him to social intercourse. These facts show that the tribe have some
close ancestral connection with the R&#257;wats and Dhobis, though the
legend of descent from the Kauravas is, of course, a myth based on the
similarity of the names. The tribe have lost their own language, if
they ever had one, and now speak a corrupt form of the
Chhatt&#299;sgarhi dialect of Hindi. It is probable that they belong to
the Dravidian tribal family.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">2. Tribal subdivisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kawars have the following eight endogamous
divisions: Tanwar, Kamalbansi, Paikara, D&#363;dh-Kawar, Rathia,
Ch&#257;nti, Cherwa and Rautia. The Tanwar group, also known as Umrao,
is that to which the zam&#299;nd&#257;rs belong, and they now claim to
be Tomara R&#257;jp&#363;ts, and wear the sacred thread. They prohibit
widow-remarriage, and do not eat fowls or drink liquor; but they have
not yet induced Br&#257;hmans to take water from them or
R&#257;jp&#363;ts to accept their daughters in marriage. The name
Tanwar is not improbably simply a corruption of Kawar, and they are
also altering their sept names to make them resemble those of eponymous
Br&#257;hmanical <i>gotras</i>. Thus Dhangur, the name of a sept, has
been altered to Dhananjaya, and Sarvaria to S&#257;ndilya. Tel&#257;si
is the name of a sept to which four zam&#299;nd&#257;rs belong, and is
on this account sometimes returned as their caste by other Kawars, who
consider it as a distinction. The zam&#299;nd&#257;ri families have
now, however, changed the name Tel&#257;si to Kairava. The Paikaras are
the most numerous subtribe, being three-fifths of the total. They
derive their name from P&#257;ik, a foot-soldier, and formerly followed
this occupation, being employed in the armies of the Haihaivansi
R&#257;jas of Ratanpur. They still worship a two-edged sword, known as
the Jhagra Khand, or &lsquo;Sword of Strife,&rsquo; on the day of
Dasahra. The Kamalbansi, or &lsquo;Stock of the Lotus,&rsquo; may be so
called as being the oldest subdivision; for the lotus is sometimes
considered the root of all things, on account of the belief that
Brahma, the creator of the world, was himself born from this flower. In
Bil&#257;spur the Kamalbansis are considered to rank next after the
Tanwars or zam&#299;nd&#257;rs&rsquo; group. Colonel Dalton states that
the term D&#363;dh or &lsquo;Milk&rsquo; Kawar has the signification of
&lsquo;Cream of the Kawars,&rsquo; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb391" href="#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span>he considered this
subcaste to be the highest. The Rathias are a territorial group, being
immigrants from R&#257;th, a wild tract of the Raigarh State. The
Rautias are probably the descendants of Kawar fathers and mothers of
the R&#257;wat (herdsman) caste. The traditional connection of the
Kawars with a R&#257;wat has already been mentioned, and even now if a
Kawar marries a R&#257;wat girl she will be admitted into the tribe,
and the children will become full Kawars. Similarly, the R&#257;wats
have a Kauria subcaste, who are also probably the offspring of mixed
marriages; and if a Kawar girl is seduced by a Kauria R&#257;wat, she
is not expelled from the tribe, as she would be for a <i>liaison</i>
with any other man who was not a Kawar. This connection is no doubt due
to the fact that until recently the Kawars and R&#257;wats, who are
themselves a very mixed caste, were accustomed to intermarry. At the
census persons returned as Rautia were included in the Kol tribe, which
has a subdivision of that name. But Mr. H&#299;ra L&#257;l&rsquo;s
inquiries establish the fact that in Chhatt&#299;sgarh they are
undoubtedly Kawars. The Cherwas are probably another hybrid group
descended from connections formed by Kawars with girls of the Chero
tribe of Chota N&#257;gpur. The Ch&#257;nti, who derive their name from
the ant, are considered to be the lowest group, as that insect is the
most insignificant of living things. Of the above subcastes the Tanwars
are naturally the highest, while the Ch&#257;nti, Cherwa and Rautia,
who keep pigs, are considered as the lowest. The others occupy an
intermediate position. None of the subcastes will eat together, except
at the houses of their zam&#299;nd&#257;rs, from whom they will all
take food. But the Kawars of the Chhuri estate no longer attend the
feasts of their zam&#299;nd&#257;r, for the following curious reason.
One of the latter&rsquo;s village <i>thek&#257;d&#257;rs</i> or farmers
had got the hide taken off a dead buffalo so as to keep it for his own
use, instead of making the body over to a Cham&#257;r (tanner). The
caste-fellows saw no harm in this act, but it offended the
zam&#299;nd&#257;r&rsquo;s more orthodox Hindu conscience. Soon
afterwards, at some marriage-feast of his family, when the Kawars of
his zam&#299;nd&#257;ri attended in accordance with the usual custom,
he remarked, &lsquo;Here come our Cham&#257;rs,&rsquo; or words to that
effect. The Chhuri Kawars were insulted, and the more so because the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=
"pb392">392</a>]</span>Pendra zam&#299;nd&#257;r and other outsiders
were present. So they declined to take food any longer from their
zam&#299;nd&#257;r. They continued to accept it, however, from the
other zam&#299;nd&#257;rs, until their master of Chhuri represented to
them that this would result in a slur being put upon his standing among
his fellows. So they have now given up taking food from any
zam&#299;nd&#257;r.</p>

<p>Generally it may be said that every common animal or bird and even
articles of food or dress and household implements have given their
names to a sept. In the Paikara subcaste a figure of the plant or
animal after which the sept is named is made by each party at the time
of marriage. Thus a bridegroom of the B&#257;gh or tiger sept prepares
a small image of a tiger with flour and bakes it in oil; this he shows
to the bride&rsquo;s family to represent, as it were, his pedigree, or
prove his legitimacy; while she on her part, assuming that she is, say,
of the Bilwa or cat sept, will bring a similar image of a cat with her
in proof of her origin. The And&#299;l sept make a representation of a
hen sitting on eggs. They do not worship the totem animal or plant, but
when they learn of the death of one of the species, they throw away an
earthen cooking-pot as a sign of mourning. They generally think
themselves descended from the totem animal or plant, but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>when
the sept is called after some inanimate object, such as a grinding-mill
or pounding-lever, they repudiate the idea of descent from it, and are
at a loss to account for the origin of the name. Those whose septs are
named after plants or animals usually abstain from injuring or cutting
them, but where this rule would cause too much inconvenience it is
transgressed: thus the members of the Kars&#257;yal or deer sept find
it too hard for them to abjure the flesh of that animal, nor can those
of the Bokra sept abstain from eating goats. In some cases new septs
have been formed by a conjunction of the names of two others, as
B&#257;gh-Daharia, Gauriya-Sonw&#257;ni, and so on. These may possibly
be analogous to the use of double names in English, a family of one
sept when it has contracted a marriage with another of better position
adding the latter&rsquo;s name to its own as a slight distinction. But
it may also simply arise from the constant tendency to increase the
number of septs in order to remove difficulties from the arrangement of
matches.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Betrothal and marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage within the same sept is prohibited and also
between the children of brothers and sisters. A man may not marry his
wife&rsquo;s elder sister but he can take her younger one in her
lifetime. Marriage is usually adult and, contrary to the Hindu rule,
the proposal for a match always comes from the boy&rsquo;s father, as a
man would think it undignified to try and find a husband for his
daughter. The Kawar says, &lsquo;Shall my daughter leap over the wall
to get a husband.<span class="corr" id="xd21e13418" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> In consequence of this girls not
infrequently remain unmarried until a comparatively late age,
especially in the zam&#299;nd&#257;ri families where the provision of a
husband of suitable rank may be difficult. Having selected a bride for
his son the boy&rsquo;s father sends some friends to her village, and
they address a friend of the girl&rsquo;s family, saying,
&ldquo;So-and-so (giving his name and village) would like to have a cup
of <i>pej</i> (boiled rice-water) from you; what do you say?&rdquo; The
proposal is communicated to the girl&rsquo;s family, and if they
approve of it they commence preparing the rice-water, which is partaken
of by the parties and their friends. If the bride&rsquo;s people do not
begin cooking the <i>pej</i>, it is understood that the proposal is
rejected. The ceremony of betrothal comes next, when the boy&rsquo;s
party go to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name=
"pb394">394</a>]</span>the girl&rsquo;s house with a present of
bangles, clothes, and fried cakes of rice and <i>urad</i> carried by a
Kaurai R&#257;wat. They also take with them the bride-price, known as
Suk, which is made up of cash, husked or unhusked rice, pulses and oil.
It is a fixed amount, but differs for each subcaste, and the average
value is about Rs. 25. To this is added three or four goats to be
consumed at the wedding. If a widower marries a girl, a larger
bride-price is exacted. The wedding follows, and in many respects
conforms to the ordinary Hindu ritual, but Br&#257;hmans are not
employed. The bridegroom&rsquo;s party is accompanied by tomtom-players
on its way to the wedding, and as each village is approached plenty of
noise is made, so that the residents may come out and admire the
dresses, a great part of whose merit consists in their antiquity, while
the wearer delights in recounting to any who will listen the history of
his garb and of his distinguished ancestors who have worn it. The
marriage is performed by walking round the sacred pole, six times on
one day and once on the following day. After the marriage the
bride&rsquo;s parents wash the feet of the couple in milk, and then
drink it in atonement for the sin committed in bringing their daughter
into the world. The couple then return home to the bridegroom&rsquo;s
house, where all the ceremonies are repeated, as it is said that
otherwise his courtyard would remain unmarried. On the following day
the couple go and bathe in a tank, where each throws five pots full of
water over the other. And on their return the bridegroom shoots arrows
at seven straw images of deer over his wife&rsquo;s shoulder, and after
each shot she puts a little sugar in his mouth. This is a common
ceremony among the forest tribes, and symbolises the idea that the man
will support himself and his wife by hunting. On the fourth day the
bride returns to her father&rsquo;s house. She visits her husband for
two or three months in the following month of As&#257;rh
(June&ndash;July), but again goes home to play what is known as
&lsquo;The game of Gauri,&rsquo; Gauri being the name of Siva&rsquo;s
consort. The young men and girls of the village assemble round her in
the evening, and the girls sing songs while the men play on drums. An
obscene representation of Gauri is made, and some of them pretend to be
possessed by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395"
name="pb395">395</a>]</span>deity, while the men beat the girls with
ropes of grass. After she has enjoyed this amusement with her mates for
some three months, the bride finally goes to her husband&rsquo;s
house.</p>

<h3 class="main">5. Other customs connected with marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The wedding expenses come to about seventy rupees on
the bridegroom&rsquo;s part in an ordinary marriage, while the
bride&rsquo;s family spend the amount of the bride-price and a few
rupees more. If the parties are poor the ceremony can be curtailed so
far as to provide food for only five guests. It is permissible for two
families to effect an exchange of girls in lieu of payment of the
bride-price, this practice being known as Gunr&#257;wat. Or a
prospective bridegroom may give his services for three or four years
instead of a price. The system of serving for a wife is known as
Gharji&#257;n, and is generally resorted to by widows having daughters.
A girl going wrong with a Kawar or with a Kaurai R&#257;wat before
marriage may be pardoned with the exaction of a feast from her parents.
For a <i>liaison</i> with any other outsider she is finally expelled,
and the exception of the Kaurai R&#257;wats shows that they are
recognised as in reality Kawars. Widow-remarriage is permitted except
in the Tanwar subcaste. New bangles and clothes are given to the widow,
and the pair then stand under the eaves of the house; the bridegroom
touches the woman&rsquo;s ear or puts a rolled mango-leaf into it, and
she becomes his wife. If a widower marries a girl for his third wife it
is considered unlucky for her. An earthen image of a woman is therefore
made, and he goes through the marriage ceremony with it; he then throws
the image to the ground so that it is broken, when it is considered to
be dead and its funeral ceremony is performed. After this the widower
may marry the girl, who becomes his fourth wife. Such cases are
naturally very rare. If a widow marries her deceased husband&rsquo;s
younger brother, which is considered the most suitable match, the
children by her first husband rank equally with those of the second. If
she marries outside the family her children and property remain with
her first husband&rsquo;s relatives.</p>

"xd21e13445src">2</a> records that the Kawars of Sarg&#363;ja had
adopted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=
"pb396">396</a>]</span>the practice of <i>sati</i>: &ldquo;I found that
the Kawars of Sarg&#363;ja encouraged widows to become Satis and
greatly venerated those who did so. Sati shrines are not uncommon in
the Tributary Mah&#257;ls. Between Part&#257;bpur and Jhilmili in
Sarg&#363;ja I encamped in a grove sacred to a Kauraini Sati. Several
generations have elapsed since the self-sacrifice that led to her
canonisation, but she is now the principal object of worship in the
village and neighbourhood, and I was informed that every year a
<i>fowl</i> was sacrificed to her, and every third year a black goat.
The Hindus with me were intensely amused at the idea of offering fowls
to a Sati!&rdquo; Polygamy is permitted, but is not common. Members of
the Tanwar subtribe, when they have occasion to do so, will take the
daughters of Kawars of other groups for wives, though they will not
give their daughters to them. Such marriages are generally made
clandestinely, and it has become doubtful as to whether some families
are true Tanwars. The zam&#299;nd&#257;rs have therefore introduced a
rule that no family can be recognised as a Tanwar for purposes of
marriage unless it has a certificate to that effect signed by the
zam&#299;nd&#257;r. Some of the zam&#299;nd&#257;rs charge considerable
sums for these certificates, and all cannot afford them; but in that
case they are usually unable to get husbands for their daughters, who
remain unwed. Divorce is permitted for serious disagreement or bad
conduct on the part of the wife.</p>

<h3 class="main">6. Childbirth.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During childbirth the mother sits on the ground with
her legs apart, and her back against the wall or supported by another
woman. The umbilical cord is cut by the midwife: if the parents wish
the boy to become eloquent she buries it in the village Council-place;
or if they wish him to be a good trader, in the market; or if they
desire him to be pious, before some shrine; in the case of a girl the
cord is usually buried in a dung-heap, which is regarded as an emblem
of fertility. As is usual in Chhatt&#299;sgarh, the mother receives no
food or water for three days after the birth of a child. On the fifth
day she is given regular food and on that day the house is purified.
Five months after birth the lips of the child are touched with rice and
milk and it is named. When twins are born a metal vessel is broken to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>sever the connection between them, as it is
believed that otherwise they must die at the same time. If a boy is
born after three girls he is called <i>titura</i>, and a girl after
three boys, <i>tituri</i>. There is a saying that &lsquo;A
<i>titura</i> child either fills the storehouse or empties it&rsquo;;
that is, his parents either become rich or penniless. To avert ill-luck
in this case oil and salt are thrown away, and the mother gives one of
her bangles to the midwife.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">7. Disposal of the dead.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dead are usually buried, though well-to-do
families have adopted cremation. The corpse is laid on its side in the
grave, with head to the north and face to the east. A little
<i>til</i>, cotton, <i>urad</i> and rice are thrown on the grave to
serve as seed-grain for the dead man&rsquo;s cultivation in the other
world. A dish, a drinking vessel and a cooking-pot are placed on the
grave with the same idea, but are afterwards taken away by the Dhobi
(washerman). They observe mourning for ten days for a man, nine days
for a woman, and three days for children under three years old. During
the period of mourning the chief mourner keeps a knife beside him, so
that the iron may ward off the attacks of evil spirits, to which he is
believed to be peculiarly exposed. The ordinary rules of abstinence and
retirement are observed during mourning. In the case of cremation the
ceremonies are very elaborate and generally resemble those of the
Hindus. When the corpse is half burnt, all the men present throw five
pieces of wood on to the pyre, and a number of pieces are carried in a
winnowing fan to the dead man&rsquo;s house, where they are touched by
the women and then brought back and thrown on to the fire. After the
funeral the mourners bathe and return home walking one behind the other
in Indian file. When they come to a cross-road, the foremost man picks
up a pebble with his left foot, and it is passed from hand to hand down
the line of men until the hindmost throws it away. This is supposed to
sever their connection with the spirit of the deceased and prevent it
from following them home. On the third day they return to the cremation
ground to collect the ashes and bones. A Br&#257;hman is called who
cooks a preparation of milk and rice at the head of the corpse, boils
<i>urad</i> pulse at its feet, and bakes eight wheaten
<i>chap&#257;tis</i> at the sides. This food <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>is
placed in leaf-cups at two corners of the ground. The mourners sprinkle
cow&rsquo;s urine and milk over the bones, and picking them up with a
<i>pal&#257;s</i> (<i>Butea frondosa</i>) stick, wash them in milk and
deposit them in a new earthen pot until such time as they can be
carried to the Ganges. The bodies of men dying of smallpox must never
be burnt, because that would be equivalent to destroying the goddess,
incarnate in the body. The corpses of cholera patients are buried in
order to dispose of them at once, and are sometimes exhumed
subsequently within a period of six months and cremated. In such a case
the Kawars spread a layer of unhusked rice in the grave, and address a
prayer to the earth-goddess stating that the body has been placed with
her on deposit, and asking that she will give it back intact when they
call upon her for it. They believe that in such cases the process of
decay is arrested for six months.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">8. Laying spirits.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When a man has been killed by a tiger they have a
ceremony called &lsquo;Breaking the string,&rsquo; or the connection
which they believe the animal establishes with a family on having
tasted its blood. Otherwise they think that the tiger would gradually
kill off all the remaining members of the family of his victim, and
when he had finished with them would proceed to other families in the
same village. This curious belief is no doubt confirmed by the
tiger&rsquo;s habit of frequenting the locality of a village from which
it has once obtained a victim, in the natural expectation that others
may be forthcoming from the same source. In this ceremony the village
Baiga or medicine-man is painted with red ochre and soot to represent
the tiger, and proceeds to the place where the victim was carried off.
Having picked up some of the blood-stained earth in his mouth, he tries
to run away to the jungle, but the spectators hold him back until he
spits out the earth. This represents the tiger being forced to give up
his victim. The Baiga then ties a string round all the members of the
dead man&rsquo;s family standing together; he places some grain before
a fowl saying, &lsquo;If my charm has worked, eat of this&rsquo;; and
as soon as the fowl has eaten some grain the Baiga states that his
efforts have been successful and the attraction of the man-eater has
been broken; he then breaks the string and all the party return
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span>to the village. A similar ceremony is performed
when a man has died of snake-bite.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">9. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The religion of the Kawars is entirely of an animistic
character. They have a vague idea of a supreme deity whom they call
Bhagw&#257;n and identify with the sun. They bow to him in reverence,
but do no more as he does not interfere with men&rsquo;s concerns. They
also have a host of local and tribal deities, of whom the principal is
the Jhagra Khand or two-edged sword, already mentioned. The tiger is
deified as Bagharra Deo and worshipped in every village for the
protection of cattle from wild animals. They are also in great fear of
a mythical snake with a red crest on its head, the mere sight of which
is believed to cause death. It lives in deep pools in the forest which
are known as <i>Shesk Kund</i>, and when it moves the grass along its
track takes fire. If a man crosses its track his colour turns to black
and he suffers excruciating pains which end in death, unless he is
relieved by the Baiga. In one village where the snake was said to have
recently appeared, the proprietor was so afraid of it that he never
went out to his field without first offering a chicken. They have
various local deities, of which the Mandwa R&#257;ni or goddess of the
Mandwa hill in Korba zam&#299;nd&#257;ri may be noticed as an example.
She is a mild-hearted maiden who puts people right when they have gone
astray in the forest, or provides them with food for the night and
guides them to the water-springs on her hill. Recently a wayfarer had
lost his path when she appeared and, guiding him into it, gave him a
basket of brinj&#257;ls.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13515src" href=
"#xd21e13515" name="xd21e13515src">3</a> As the traveller proceeded he
felt his burden growing heavier and heavier on his head, and finally on
inspecting it found that the goddess had played a little joke on him
and the brinj&#257;ls had turned into stones. The Kawars implicitly
believe this story. Rivers are tenanted by a set of goddesses called
the Sat Bahini or seven sisters. They delight in playing near
waterfalls, holding up the water and suddenly letting it drop. Trees
are believed to be harmless sentient beings, except when occasionally
possessed by evil spirits, such as the ghosts of man-eating tigers.
Sometimes a tree catches hold of a cow&rsquo;s tail as the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=
"pb400">400</a>]</span>animal passes by and winds it up over a branch,
and many cattle have lost their tails in this way. Every tank in which
the lotus grows is tenanted by Purainha, the godling who tends this
plant. The sword, the gun, the axe, the spear have each a special
deity, and, in fact, in the Bangaw&#257;n, the tract where the wilder
Kawars dwell, it is believed that every article of household furniture
is the residence of a spirit, and that if any one steals or injures it
without the owner&rsquo;s leave, the spirit will bring some misfortune
on him in revenge. Theft is said to be unknown among them, partly on
this account and partly, perhaps, because no one has much property
worth stealing. Instances of deified human beings are Kolin Sati, a Kol
concubine of a zam&#299;nd&#257;r of Pendra who died during pregnancy,
and S&#257;rangarhni, a Ghasia woman who was believed to have been the
mistress of a R&#257;ja of S&#257;rangarh and was murdered. Both are
now Kawar deities. Th&#257;kur Deo is the deity of agriculture, and is
worshipped by the whole village in concert at the commencement of the
rains. Rice is brought by each cultivator and offered to the god, a
little being sown at his shrine and the remainder taken home and mixed
with the seed-grain to give it fertility. Two bachelors carry water
round the village and sprinkle it on the brass plates of the
cultivators or the roofs of their houses in imitation of rain.</p>

<h3 class="main">10. Magic and witchcraft.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The belief in witchcraft is universal and every
village has its <i>tonhi</i> or witch, to whom epidemic diseases,
sudden illnesses and other calamities are ascribed. The witch is nearly
always some unpopular old woman, and several instances are known of the
murder of these unfortunate creatures, after their crimes had been
proclaimed by the Baiga or medicine-man. In the famine of 1900 an old
woman from another village came and joined one of the famine-kitchens.
A few days afterwards the village watchman got ill, and when the Baiga
was called in he said the old woman was a witch who had vowed the lives
of twenty children to her goddess, and had joined the kitchen to kill
them. The woman was threatened with a beating with castor-oil plants if
she did not leave the village, and as the kitchen officer refused to
supply her with food, she had to go. The Baiga takes action to stop and
keep off epidemics <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401"
name="pb401">401</a>]</span>by the methods common in Chhatt&#299;sgarh
villages. When a woman asks him to procure her offspring, the Baiga
sits <i>dharna</i> in front of Devi&rsquo;s shrine and fasts until the
goddess, wearied by his importunity, descends on him and causes him to
prophesy the birth of a child. They have the usual belief in imitative
and sympathetic magic. If a person is wounded by an axe he throws it
first into fire and then into cold water. By the first operation he
thinks to dry up the wound and prevent its festering, and by the second
to keep it cool. Thin and lean children are weighed in a balance
against moist cowdung with the idea that they will swell out as the
dung dries up. In order to make a bullock&rsquo;s hump grow, a large
grain-measure is placed over it. If cattle go astray an iron implement
is placed in a pitcher of water, and it is believed that this will keep
wild animals off the cattle, though the connection of ideas is obscure.
To cure intermittent fever a man walks through a narrow passage between
two houses. If the children in a family die, the Baiga takes the
parents outside the village and breaks the stem of some plant in their
presence. After this they never again touch that particular plant, and
it is believed that their children will not die. Tuesday is considered
the best day for weddings, Thursday and Monday for beginning field-work
and Saturday for worshipping the gods. To have bats in one&rsquo;s
granary is considered to be fortunate, and there is a large harmless
snake which, they say, produces fertility when it makes its home in a
field. If a crow caws on the house-top they consider that the arrival
of a guest is portended. A snake or a cat crossing the road in front
and a man sneezing are bad omens.</p>

<p class="first">The dress of the Kawars presents no special features
calling for remark. Women wear pewter ornaments on the feet, and silver
or pewter rings on the neck. They decorate the ears with silver
pendants, but as a rule do not wear nose-rings. Women are tattooed on
the breast with a figure of Krishna, on the arms with that of a deer,
and on the legs with miscellaneous patterns. The operation is carried
out immediately after marriage in accordance with the usual custom in
Chhatt&#299;sgarh.</p>

<h3 class="main">12. Occupation and social rules.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tribe consider military service to be their
traditional <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name=
"pb402">402</a>]</span>occupation, but the bulk of them are now
cultivators and labourers. Many of them are farmers of villages in the
zam&#299;nd&#257;ris. Rautias weave ropes and make sleeping-cots, but
the other Kawars consider such work to be degrading. They have the
ordinary Hindu rules of inheritance, but a son claiming partition in
his father&rsquo;s lifetime is entitled to two bullocks and nothing
more. When the property is divided on the death of the father, the
eldest son receives an allowance known as <i>jithai</i> over and above
his share, this being a common custom in the Chhatt&#299;sgarh country
where the Kawars reside. The tribe do not admit outsiders with the
exception of Kaurai R&#257;wat girls married to Kawars. They have a
tribal <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee, the head of which is known
as Pardh&#257;n. Its proceedings are generally very deliberate, and
this has led to the saying: &ldquo;The Ganda&rsquo;s
<i>panch&#257;yat</i> always ends in a quarrel; the Gond&rsquo;s
<i>panch&#257;yat</i> cares only for the feast; and the Kawar&rsquo;s
<i>panch&#257;yat</i> takes a year to make up its mind.&rdquo; But when
the Kawars have decided, they act with vigour. They require numerous
goats as fines for the caste feast, and these, with fried <i>urad</i>,
form the regular provision. Liquor, however, is only sparingly
consumed. Temporary exclusion from caste is imposed for the usual
offences, which include going to jail, getting the ears split, or
getting maggots in a wound. The last is the most serious offence, and
when the culprit is readmitted to social intercourse the Dhobi
(washerman) is employed to eat with him first from five different
plates, thus taking upon himself any risk of contagion from the
impurity which may still remain. The Kawar eats flesh, fowls and pork,
but abjures beef, crocodiles, monkeys and reptiles. From birds he
selects the parrot, dove, pigeon, quail and partridge as fit for food.
He will not eat meat sold in market because he considers it
<i>hal&#257;li</i> or killed in the Muhammadan fashion, and therefore
impure. He also refuses a particular species of fish called
<i>rechha</i>, which is black and fleshy and has been nicknamed
&lsquo;The Tel&#299;&rsquo;s bullock.&rsquo; The higher subtribes have
now given up eating pork and the Tanwars abstain from fowls also. The
Kawars will take food only from a Gond or a Kaurai R&#257;wat, and
Gonds will also take food from them. In appearance and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>manners they greatly resemble the Gonds, from
whom they are hardly distinguished by the Hindus. Dalton<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13573src" href="#xd21e13573" name=
"xd21e13573src">4</a> described them as &ldquo;A dark, coarse-featured,
broad-nosed, wide-mouthed and thick-lipped race, decidedly ugly, but
taller and better set up than most of the other tribes. I have also
found them a clean, well-to-do, industrious people, living in
comfortable, carefully-constructed and healthily-kept houses and well
dressed.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;In the evening some of the villagers&mdash;Kaurs they were I

from anything seen among the Sant&#257;ls or Kols. A number of men
performed a kind of ladies&rsquo; chain, striking together as they
passed one another&rsquo;s pronged sticks which they carried in their
hands. By foot, hand and voice the time given by a tom-tom is most
admirably kept.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href=

<p class="first"><b>K&#257;yasth</b>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13680src" href="#xd21e13680" name="xd21e13680src">1</a>
<b>Kaith</b>, <b>L&#257;la</b>.&mdash;The caste of writers and village
accountants. The K&#257;yasths numbered 34,000 persons in 1911 and were
found over the whole Province, but they are most numerous in the
Saugor, Damoh, Jubbulpore and Narsinghpur Districts. In the
Mar&#257;tha country their place is to some extent taken by the
Prabhus, the Mar&#257;tha writer caste, and also by the Vid&#363;rs. No
probable derivation of the name K&#257;yasth appears to have been
suggested. The earliest reference to K&#257;yasths appears in an
inscription in M&#257;lwa dated <span class="sc">A.D.</span>
738&ndash;739. The inscription is of a Maurya king, and the term
K&#257;yasth is used there as a proper noun to mean a writer. Another
dated <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 987 is written by a K&#257;yasth
named K&#257;nchana. An inscription on the Delhi Siw&#257;lik pillar
dated <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1164 is stated to have been written
by a K&#257;yasth named Sispati, the son of M&#257;hava, by the
king&rsquo;s command. The inscription adds that the K&#257;yasth was of
Gauda (Bengal) descent, and the term K&#257;yasth is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>here
used in the sense of a member of the K&#257;yasth caste and not simply
meaning a writer as in the M&#257;lwa inscription.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e13701src" href="#xd21e13701" name="xd21e13701src">2</a> From
the above account it seems possible that the caste was of comparatively
late origin. According to their own legend the first progenitor of the
K&#257;yasths was Chitragupta, who was created by Brahma from his own
body and given to Yama the king of the dead, to record the good and
evil actions of all beings, and produce the result when they arrived in
the kingdom of the dead. Chitragupta was called K&#257;yastha, from
<i>kaya stha</i>, existing in or incorporate in the body, because he
was in the body of Brahma. Chitragupta was born of a dark complexion,
and having a pen and ink-pot in his hand. He married two wives, the
elder being the granddaughter of the sun, who bore him four sons, while
the younger was the daughter of a Br&#257;hman Rishi, and by her he had
eight sons. These sons were married to princesses of the N&#257;ga or
snake race; the N&#257;gas are supposed to have been the early nomad
invaders from Central Asia, or Scythians. The twelve sons were
entrusted with the government of different parts of India and the
twelve subcastes of K&#257;yasths are named after these localities.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. The origin of the caste.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There has been much discussion on the origin of the
K&#257;yasth caste, which now occupies a high social position owing to
the ability and industry of its members and their attainment of good
positions in the public services. All indications, however, point to
the fact that the caste has obtained within a comparatively recent
period a great rise in social status, and formerly ranked much lower
than it does now. Dr. Bhattach&#257;rya states:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13717src" href="#xd21e13717" name="xd21e13717src">3</a>
&ldquo;The K&#257;yasths of Bengal are described in some of the Hindu
sacred books as Kshatriyas, but the majority of the K&#257;yasth clans
do not wear the sacred thread, and admit their status as S&#363;dra
also by the observance of mourning for thirty days. But whether
Kshatriya or S&#363;dra, they belong to the upper layer of Hindu
society, and though the higher classes of Br&#257;hmans neither perform
their religious ceremonies nor enlist them among their disciples, yet
the gifts of the K&#257;yasths are usually accepted by the great
Pandits of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span>country without hesitation.&rdquo; There is no
doubt that a hundred years ago the K&#257;yasths of Bengal and
Bih&#257;r were commonly looked upon as S&#363;dras. Dr. Buchanan, an
excellent observer, states this several times. In Bih&#257;r he says
that the K&#257;yasths are the chief caste who are looked upon by all
as pure S&#363;dras and do not reject the appellation.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13724src" href="#xd21e13724" name=
"xd21e13724src">4</a> And again that &ldquo;Pandits in Gorakhpur insist
that K&#257;yasths are mere S&#363;dras, but on account of their
influence included among gentry (<i>Ashr&#257;f</i>). All who have been
long settled in the district live pure and endeavour to elevate
themselves; but this has failed of success as kindred from other
countries who still drink liquor and eat meat come and sit on the same
mat with them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13732src" href=
"#xd21e13732" name="xd21e13732src">5</a> Again he calls the
K&#257;yasths the highest S&#363;dras next to Vaidyas.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13738src" href="#xd21e13738" name=
"xd21e13738src">6</a> And &ldquo;In Bih&#257;r the penmen
(K&#257;yasthas) are placed next to the Kshatris and by the
Br&#257;hmans are considered as illegitimate, to whom the rank of
S&#363;dras has been given, and in general they do not presume to be
angry at this decision, which in Bengal would be highly
offensive.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13743src" href="#xd21e13743"
name="xd21e13743src">7</a> Colebrooke remarks of the caste:
&ldquo;Karana, from a Vaishya by a woman of the S&#363;dra class, is an
attendant on princes or secretary. The appellation of K&#257;yastha is
in general considered as synonymous with Karana; and accordingly the
Karana tribe commonly assumes the name of K&#257;yastha; but the
K&#257;yasthas of Bengal have pretensions to be considered as true
S&#363;dras, which the J&#257;tim&#257;la seems to authorise, for the
origin of the K&#257;yastha is there mentioned before the subject of
mixed castes is introduced, immediately after describing the Gopa as a
true S&#363;dra.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13748src" href=
"#xd21e13748" name="xd21e13748src">8</a> Similarly Colonel Dalton says:
&ldquo;I believe that in the present day the K&#257;yasths arrogate to
themselves the position of first among commoners, or first of the
S&#363;dras, but their origin is involved in some mystery. Intelligent
K&#257;yasths make no pretension to be other than
S&#363;dras.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13753src" href=
"#xd21e13753" name="xd21e13753src">9</a> In his Census Report of the
United Provinces Mr. R. Burn discusses the subject as follows:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13758src" href="#xd21e13758" name=
"xd21e13758src">10</a> &ldquo;On the authority of these Pur&#257;nic
accounts, and in view of the fact that the K&#257;yasths observe
certain of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>Sansk&#257;rs in the same method as is
prescribed for Kshatriyas, the Pandits of several places have given
formal opinions that the K&#257;yasths are Kshatriyas. On the other
hand, there is not the slightest doubt that the K&#257;yasths are
commonly regarded either as a mixed caste, with some relationship to
two if not three of the twice-born castes, or as S&#363;dras. This is
openly stated in some of the reports, and not a single Hindu who was
not a K&#257;yasth of the many I have personally asked about the matter
would admit privately that the K&#257;yasths are twice-born, and the
same opinion was expressed by Muhammadans, who were in a position to
gauge the ordinary ideas held by Hindus, and are entirely free from
prejudice in the matter. One of the most highly respected orthodox
Br&#257;hmans in the Provinces wrote to me confirming this opinion, and
at the same time asked that his name might not be published in
connection with it. The matter has been very minutely examined in a
paper sent up by a member of the Ben&#257;res committee who came to the
conclusion that while the K&#257;yasths have been declared to be
Kshatriyas in the Pur&#257;nas, by Pandits, and in several judgments of
subordinate courts, and to be S&#363;dras by Manu and various
commentators on him, by public opinion, and in a judgment of the High
Court of Calcutta, they are really of Br&#257;hmanical origin. He holds
that those who to-day follow literary occupations are the descendants
of Chitragupta by his Br&#257;hman and Kshatriya wives, that the
so-called <span class="corr" id="xd21e13766" title=
"Source: Unaya">Un&#257;ya</span> K&#257;yasths are descended from
Vaishya mothers, and the tailors and cobblers from S&#363;dra mothers.
It is possible to trace to some extent points which have affected
public opinion on this question. The K&#257;yasths themselves admit
that in the past their reputation as hard drinkers was not altogether
unmerited, but they deserve the highest credit for the improvements
which have been effected in this regard. There is also a widespread
belief that the existing general observance by K&#257;yasths of the
ceremonies prescribed for the twice-born castes, especially in the
matter of wearing the sacred thread, is comparatively recent. It is
almost superfluous to add that notwithstanding the theoretical views
held as to their origin and position, K&#257;yasths <span class="corr"
id="xd21e13769" title="Source: undoubtededly">undoubtedly</span> rank
high in the social scale. All European <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb408" href="#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span>writers have borne
testimony to their excellence and success in many walks of life, and
even before the commencement of British power many K&#257;yasths
occupied high social positions and enjoyed the confidence of their
rulers.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">3. The rise of the K&#257;yasths under foreign
rulers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It appears then a legitimate conclusion from the
evidence that the claim of the K&#257;yasths to be Kshatriyas is
comparatively recent, and that a century ago they occupied a very much
lower social position than they do now. We do not find them playing any
prominent part in the early or medi&aelig;val Hindu kingdoms. There is
considerable reason for supposing that their rise to importance took
place under the foreign or non-Hindu governments in India. Thus a
prominent K&#257;yasth gentleman says of his own caste:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13779src" href="#xd21e13779" name=
"xd21e13779src">11</a> &ldquo;The people of this caste were the first
to learn Persian, the language of the Muhammadan invaders of India, and
to obtain the posts of accountants and revenue collectors under
Muhammadan kings. Their chief occupation is Government service, and if
one of the caste adopts any other profession he is degraded in the
estimation of his caste-fellows.&rdquo; Malcolm states:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13788src" href="#xd21e13788" name=
"xd21e13788src">12</a> &ldquo;When the Muhammadans invaded
Hindust&#257;n and conquered its R&#257;jp&#363;t princes, we may
conclude that the Br&#257;hmans of that country who possessed knowledge
or distinction fled from their intolerance and violence; but the
conquerors found in the K&#257;yastha or Kaith tribe more pliable and
better instruments for the conduct of the details of their new
Government. This tribe had few religious scruples, as they stand low in
the scale of Hindus. They were, according to their own records, which
there is no reason to question, qualified by their previous employment
in all affairs of state; and to render themselves completely useful had
only to add the language of their new masters to those with which they
were already acquainted. The Muhammadans carried these Hindus into
their southern conquests, and they spread over the countries of Central
India and the Deccan; and some families who are K&#257;nungos<a class=

id="xd21e13798" title="Source: patwaris">patw&#257;ris</span> of
villages trace their settlement in this country from the earliest
Muhammadan conquest.&rdquo; Similarly the <i>Bombay Gazetteer</i>
states that under the arrangements made by the Emperor Akbar, the work
of collecting the revenues of the twenty-eight Districts subordinate to
Surat was entrusted to K&#257;yasths.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13805src" href="#xd21e13805" name="xd21e13805src">14</a> And the
M&#257;thur K&#257;yasths of Gujar&#257;t came from Mathura in the
train of the Mughal viceroys as their clerks and interpreters.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13810src" href="#xd21e13810" name=
"xd21e13810src">15</a> Under the Muhammadans and for some time after
the introduction of English rule, a knowledge of Persian was required
in a Government clerk, and in this language most of the K&#257;yasths
were proficient, and some were excellent clerks.<a class="noteref" id=

K&#257;yasths attained very high positions under the Muhammadan kings
of Bengal and were in charge of the revenue department under the
Naw&#257;bs of Mursh&#299;d&#257;b&#257;d; while Rai Durlao R&#257;m,
prime minister of Ali Verdi Kh&#257;n, was a K&#257;yasth. The
governors of Bih&#257;r in the period between the battle of Plassey and
the removal of the exchequer to Calcutta were also
K&#257;yasths.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13820src" href="#xd21e13820"

id="xd21e13833src" href="#xd21e13833" name="xd21e13833src">19</a>
Similarly the K&#257;yasths entered the service of the Gond kings of
the Central Provinces. It is said that when the Gond ruler Bakht Buland
of Deogarh in Chhindw&#257;ra went to Delhi, he brought a number of
K&#257;yasths back with him and introduced them into the
administration. One of these was appointed Bakshi or paymaster to the
army of Bakht Buland. His descendant is a leading landholder in the
Seoni District with an estate of eighty-four villages. Another
K&#257;yasth landholder of Jubbulpore and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb410" href="#pb410" name="pb410">410</a>]</span>Mandla occupied some
similar position in the service of the Gond kings of Garha-Mandla.</p>
<p>Finally in the English administration the K&#257;yasths at first
monopolised the ministerial service. In the United Provinces, Bengal
and Bih&#257;r, it is stated that the number of K&#257;yasths may
perhaps even now exceed that of all other castes taken
together.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13843src" href="#xd21e13843" name=
"xd21e13843src">20</a> And in Gujar&#257;t the K&#257;yasths have lost
in recent years the monopoly they once enjoyed as Government
clerks.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13849src" href="#xd21e13849" name=
"xd21e13849src">21</a> The Mathura K&#257;yasths of Gujar&#257;t are
said to be declining in prosperity on account of the present keen
competition for Government service,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13854src" href="#xd21e13854" name="xd21e13854src">22</a> of which
it would thus appear they formerly had as large a share as they
desired. The Prabhus, the writer-caste of western India corresponding
to the K&#257;yasths, were from the time of the earliest European
settlements much trusted by English merchants, and when the British
first became supreme in Gujar&#257;t they had almost a monopoly of the
Government service as English writers. To such an extent was this the
case that the word Prabhu or Purvu was the general term for a clerk who
could write English, whether he was a Br&#257;hman, Sun&#257;r, Prabhu,
Portuguese or of English descent.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13859src"
href="#xd21e13859" name="xd21e13859src">23</a> Similarly the word
Cranny was a name applied to a clerk writing English, and thence
vulgarly applied in general to the East Indians or half-caste class
from among whom English copyists were afterwards chiefly recruited. The
original is the Hindi <i>kar&#257;ni, kir&#257;ni</i>, which Wilson
derives from the Sanskrit <i>karan</i>, a doer. Karana is also the name
of the Orissa writer-caste, who are writers and accountants. It is
probable that the name is derived from this caste, that is the Uriya
K&#257;yasths, who may have been chiefly employed as clerks before any
considerable Eurasian community had come into existence. Writers&rsquo;
Buildings at Calcutta were recently still known to the natives as
Kar&#257;ni ki Bar&#299;k, and this supports the derivation from the
Karans or Uriya K&#257;yasths, the case thus being an exact parallel to
that of the Prabhus in Bombay.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13874src"

<h3 class="main">4. The original profession of the K&#257;yasths.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From the above argument it seems legitimate to deduce
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name=
"pb411">411</a>]</span>that the K&#257;yasths formerly occupied a lower
position in Hindu society. The Br&#257;hmans were no doubt jealous of
them and, as Dr. Bhattach&#257;rya states, would not let them learn
Sanskrit.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13889src" href="#xd21e13889" name=
"xd21e13889src">25</a> But when India became subject to foreign rulers
the K&#257;yasths readily entered their service, learning the language
of their new employers in order to increase their efficiency. Thus they
first learnt Persian and then English, and both by Muhammadans and
English were employed largely, if not at first almost exclusively, as
clerks in the public offices. It must be remembered that there were at
this time practically only two other literate castes among Hindus, the
Br&#257;hmans and the Banias. The Br&#257;hmans naturally would be for
long reluctant to lower their dignity by taking service under foreign
masters, whom they regarded as outcaste and impure; while the Banias
down to within the last twenty years or so have never cared for
education beyond the degree necessary for managing their business. Thus
the K&#257;yasths had at first almost a monopoly of public employment
under foreign Governments. It has been seen also that it is only within
about the last century that the status of the K&#257;yasths has greatly
risen, and it is a legitimate deduction that the improvement dates from
the period when they began to earn distinction and importance under
these governments. But they were always a literate caste, and the
conclusion is that in former times they discharged duties to which
literacy was essential in a comparatively humble sphere. &ldquo;The
earliest reference to the K&#257;yasths as a distinct caste,&rdquo; Sir
H. Risley states, &ldquo;occurs in Y&#257;jnavalkya, who describes them
as writers and village accountants, very exacting in their demands from
the cultivators.&rdquo; The profession of patw&#257;ri or village
accountant appears to have been that formerly appertaining to the
K&#257;yasth caste, and it is one which they still largely follow. In
Bengal it is now stated that K&#257;yasths of good position object to
marry their daughters in the families of those who have served as
patw&#257;ris or village accountants. Patw&#257;ris, one of them said
to Sir H. Risley, however rich they may be, are considered as socially
lower than other K&#257;yasths, <i>e.g.</i> K&#257;nungo, Akhauri,
P&#257;nde or Bakshi. Thus it appears that the old patw&#257;ri
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name=
"pb412">412</a>]</span>K&#257;yasths are looked down upon by those who
have improved their position in more important branches of Government
service. K&#257;nungo, as explained, is a sort of head of the
patw&#257;ris; and Bakshi, a post already noticed as held by a
K&#257;yasth in the Central Provinces, is the Muhammadan office of
paymaster.</p>
<p>Similarly Mr. Crooke states that while the higher members of the
caste stand well in general repute, the village L&#257;la (or
K&#257;yasth), who is very often an accountant, is in evil odour for
his astuteness and chicanery. In Central India, as already seen, they
are K&#257;nungos of Districts and patw&#257;ris of villages; and here
again Malcolm states that these officials were the oldest settlers, and
that the later comers, who held more important posts, did not
intermarry with them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13901src" href=
"#xd21e13901" name="xd21e13901src">26</a> In Gujar&#257;t the work of
collecting the revenue in the Surat tract was entrusted to
K&#257;yasths. Till 1868, in the English villages, and up to the
present time in the Baroda villages, the subdivisional accountants were
mostly K&#257;yasths.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13908src" href=
"#xd21e13908" name="xd21e13908src">27</a> In the Central Provinces the
bulk of the patw&#257;ris in the northern Districts and a large
proportion in other Districts outside the Mar&#257;tha country are
K&#257;yasths. If the K&#257;yasths were originally patw&#257;ris or
village accountants, their former low status is fully explained. The
village accountant would be a village servant, though an important one,
and would be supported like the other village artisans by contributions
of grain from the cultivators. This is the manner in which
patw&#257;ris of the Central Provinces were formerly paid. His status
would technically be lower than that of the cultivators, and he might
be considered as a S&#363;dra or a mixed caste.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. The caste an offshoot from Br&#257;hmans.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As regards the origin of the K&#257;yasths, the most
probable hypothesis would seem to be that they were an offshoot of
Br&#257;hmans of irregular descent. The reason for this is that the
K&#257;yasths must have learnt reading and writing from some outside
source, and the Br&#257;hmans were the only class who could teach it
them. The Br&#257;hmans were not disposed to spread the benefits of
education, which was the main source of their power, with undue
liberality, and when another literate class was required for the
performance of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>duties which they disdained to discharge
themselves, it would be natural that they should prefer to educate
people closely connected with them and having claims on their support.
In this connection the tradition recorded by Sir H. Risley may be noted
to the effect that the ancestors of the Bengal K&#257;yasths were five
of the caste who came from Kanauj in attendance on five Br&#257;hmans
who had been summoned by the king of Bengal to perform for him certain
Vedic ceremonies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13920src" href=
"#xd21e13920" name="xd21e13920src">28</a> It may be noted also that the
Vid&#363;rs, another caste admittedly of irregular descent from
Br&#257;hmans, occupy the position of patw&#257;ris and village
accountants in the Mar&#257;tha districts. The names of their subcastes
indicate generally that the home of the K&#257;yasths is the country of
Hindust&#257;n, the United Provinces, and part of Bengal. This is also
the place of origin of the northern Br&#257;hmans, as shown by the
names of their most important groups. The R&#257;jp&#363;ts and Banias
on the other hand belong mainly to R&#257;jput&#257;na, Gujar&#257;t
and Bundelkhand, and in most of this area the K&#257;yasths are
immigrants. It has been seen that they came to M&#257;lwa and
Gujar&#257;t with the Muhammadans; the number of K&#257;yasths returned
from R&#257;jput&#257;na at the census was quite small, and it is
doubtful whether the K&#257;yasths are so much as mentioned in
Tod&rsquo;s <i>R&#257;jasth&#257;n</i>. The hypothesis therefore of
their being derived either from the R&#257;jp&#363;ts or Banias appears
to be untenable. In the Punjab also the K&#257;yasths are found only in
small numbers and are immigrants. As stated by Sir H. Risley, both the
physical type of the K&#257;yasths and their remarkable intellectual
attainments indicate that they possess Aryan blood; similarly Mr.
Sherring remarks: &ldquo;He nevertheless exhibits a family likeness to
the Br&#257;hman; you may not know where to place him or how to
designate him; but on looking at him and conversing with him you feel
quite sure that you are in the presence of a Hindu of no mean order of
intellect.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13928src" href=
"#xd21e13928" name="xd21e13928src">29</a> No doubt there was formerly
much mixture of blood in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href=
"#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>caste; some time ago the
K&#257;yasths were rather noted for keeping women of other castes, and
Sir H. Risley gives instances of outsiders being admitted into the
caste. Dr. Bhattach&#257;rya states<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13939src" href="#xd21e13939" name="xd21e13939src">30</a> that,
&ldquo;There are many K&#257;yasths in eastern Bengal who are called
Ghul&#257;ms or slaves. Some of them are still attached as domestic
servants to the families of the local Br&#257;hmans, Vaidyas and
aristocratic K&#257;yasths. Some of the Ghul&#257;ms have in recent
times become rich landholders, and it is said that one of them has got
the title of Rai Bah&#257;dur from Government. The marriage of a
Ghul&#257;m generally takes place in his own class, but instances of
Ghul&#257;ms marrying into aristocratic K&#257;yasth families are at
present not very rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, the Dakshina R&#257;rhi K&#257;yasths affect the greatest
veneration for the Br&#257;hmans and profess to believe in the legend
that traces their descent from the five menial servants who accompanied
the five Br&#257;hmans invited by king Adisur. The Uttara R&#257;rhi
K&#257;yasths or those of northern Burdw&#257;n, on the other hand, do
not profess the same veneration for Br&#257;hmans as the southerners,
and deny the authenticity of the legend. It was this class which held
some of the highest offices under the Muhammadan rulers of Bengal, and
several leading zam&#299;nd&#257;rs or landholders at present belong to
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13946src" href="#xd21e13946" name=
"xd21e13946src">31</a> It was probably in this capacity of village
accountant that the K&#257;yasth incurred the traditional hostility of
one or two of the lower castes which still subsists in legend.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13951src" href="#xd21e13951" name=
"xd21e13951src">32</a> The influence which the patw&#257;ri possesses
at present, even under the most vigorous and careful supervision and
with the liability to severe punishment for any abuse of his position,
is a sufficient indication of what his power must have been when
supervision and control were almost nominal. On this point Sir Henry
Maine remarks in his description of the village community: &ldquo;There
is always a village accountant, an important personage among an
unlettered population; so important indeed, and so conspicuous that,
according to the reports current in India, the earliest English
functionaries engaged in settlements of land were occasionally led, by
their assumption that there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href=
"#pb415" name="pb415">415</a>]</span>must be a single proprietor
somewhere, to mistake the accountant for the owner of the village, and
to record him as such in the official register.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13956src" href="#xd21e13956" name="xd21e13956src">33</a> In
Bih&#257;r Sir H. Risley shows that K&#257;yasths have obtained
proprietary right in a large area.</p>

<h3 class="main">6. The success of the K&#257;yasths and their present
position.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It may be hoped that the leading members of the
K&#257;yasth caste will not take offence, because in the discussion of
the origin of their caste, one of the most interesting problems of
Indian ethnology, it has been necessary to put forward a hypothesis
other than that which they hold themselves. It would be as unreasonable
for a K&#257;yasth to feel aggrieved at the suggestion that centuries
ago their ancestors were to some extent the offspring of mixed unions
as for an Englishman to be insulted by the statement that the English
are of mixed descent from Saxons, Danes and Normans. If the
K&#257;yasths formerly had a comparatively humble status in Hindu
society, then it is the more creditable to the whole community that
they should have succeeded in raising themselves by their native
industry and ability without adventitious advantages to the high
position in which by general admission the caste now stands. At present
the K&#257;yasths are certainly the highest caste after Br&#257;hman,
R&#257;jp&#363;t and Bania, and probably in Hindust&#257;n, Bengal and
the Central Provinces they may be accounted as practically equal to
R&#257;jp&#363;ts and Banias. Of the Bengal K&#257;yasths Dr.
Bhattach&#257;rya wrote:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13966src" href=
"#xd21e13966" name="xd21e13966src">34</a> &ldquo;They generally prove
equal to any position in which they are placed. They have been
successful not only as clerks but in the very highest executive and
judicial offices that have yet been thrown open to the natives of this
country. The names of the K&#257;yastha judges, Dw&#257;rka N&#257;th
Mitra, Ramesh Chandra Mitra and Chandra M&#257;dhava Ghose are well
known and respected by all. In the executive services the K&#257;yasths
have attained the same kind of success. One of them, Mr. R. C. Dutt, is
now the Commissioner of one of the most important divisions of Bengal.
Another, named K&#257;lika D&#257;s Datta, has been for several years
employed as Prime Minister of the Kuch Bih&#257;r State, giving signal
proofs of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span>his ability as an administrator by the success
with which he has been managing the affairs of the principality in his
charge.&rdquo; In the Central Provinces, too, K&#257;yasth gentlemen
hold the most important positions in the administrative, judicial and
public works departments, as well as being strongly represented in the
Provincial and subordinate executive services. And in many Districts
K&#257;yasths form the backbone of the ministerial staff of the public
offices, a class whose patient laboriousness and devotion to duty, with
only the most remote prospects of advancement to encourage them to
persevere, deserve high commendation.</p>

<h3 class="main">7. Subcastes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The northern India K&#257;yasths are divided into the
following twelve subcastes, which are mainly of a territorial
character:</p>
<ul>
<li>(<i>a</i>) Sriv&#257;stab.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Saksena.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) Bhatn&#257;gar.</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) Ambastha or Amisht.</li>
<li>(<i>e</i>) Ashth&#257;na or Aith&#257;na.</li>

<li>(<i>g</i>) M&#257;thur.</li>
<li>(<i>h</i>) Kulsreshtha.</li>
<li>(<i>i</i>) S&#363;ryadhwaja.</li>
<li>(<i>k</i>) Karan.</li>
<li>(<i>l</i>) Gaur.</li>
<li>(<i>m</i>) Nigum.</li>
</ul>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The Sriv&#257;stab subcaste take their name from the old
town of Srav&#257;sti, now Sahet-Mahet, in the north of the United
Provinces. They are by far the most numerous subcaste both there and
here. In these Provinces nearly all the K&#257;yasths are
Sriv&#257;stabs except a few Saksenas. They are divided into two
sections, Khare and D&#363;sre, which correspond to the B&#299;sa and
Dasa groups of the Banias. The Khare are those of pure descent, and the
D&#363;sre the offspring of remarried widows or other irregular
alliances.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The Saksena are named from the old town of Sankisa, in
the Farukh&#257;b&#257;d District. They also have the Khare and
D&#363;sre groups, and a third section called Kharua, which is said to
mean pure, and is perhaps the most aristocratic. A number of Saksena
K&#257;yasths are resident in Seoni District, where their ancestors
were settled by Bakht Buland, the Gond R&#257;ja of Deogarh in
Chh&#299;ndw&#257;ra. These constituted hitherto a separate endogamous
group, marrying among themselves, but since the opening of the railway
negotiations <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span>have been initiated with the Saksenas of
northern India, with the result that intermarriage is to be resumed
between the two sections.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The Bhatn&#257;gar take their name from the old town of
Bh&#257;tner, near Bikaner. They are divided into the Vaishya or
Kad&#299;m, of pure descent, and the Gaur, who are apparently the
offspring of intermarriage with the Gaur subcaste.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Ambastha or Amisht. These are said to have settled on the
Girn&#257;r hill, and to take their name from their worship of the
goddess Amb&#257;ji or Amba Devi. Mr. Crooke suggests that they may be
connected with the old Ambastha caste who were noted for their skill in
medicine. The practice of surgery is the occupation of some
K&#257;yasths.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14066src" href="#xd21e14066"
name="xd21e14066src">35</a> It is also supposed that the names may come
from the Ameth pargana of Oudh. The Ambastha K&#257;yasths are chiefly
found in south Bih&#257;r, where they are numerous and
influential.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14071src" href="#xd21e14071"
name="xd21e14071src">36</a></p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Ashth&#257;na or Aith&#257;na. This is an Oudh subcaste.
They have two groups, the P&#363;rabi or eastern, who are found in
Jaunpur and its neighbourhood, and the Pachhauri or western, who live
in or about Lucknow.</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) B&#257;lm&#299;k or V&#257;lm&#299;ki. These are a
subcaste of western India. B&#257;lm&#299;k or V&#257;lm&#299;k was the
traditional author of the R&#257;m&#257;yana, but they do not trace
their descent from him. The name may have some territorial meaning. The
V&#257;lm&#299;ki are divided into three endogamous groups according as
they live in Bombay, Cutch or Surat.</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) The M&#257;thur subcaste are named after Mathura or
Muttra. They are also split into the local groups Dihlawi of Delhi,
Katchi of Cutch and Lachauli of Jodhpur.</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) The Kulsreshtha or &lsquo;well-born&rsquo; K&#257;yasths
belong chiefly to the districts of Agra and Etah. They are divided into
the B&#257;rakhhera, or those of twelve villages, and the Chha Khera of
six villages.</p>
<p>(<i>i</i>) The S&#363;ryadhwaja subcaste belong to Ballia,
Gh&#257;zi-pur and Bijnor. Their origin is obscure. They profess
excessive purity, and call themselves Sakadw&#299;pi or Scythian
Br&#257;hmans. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418" name=
"pb418">418</a>]</span></p>
<p>(<i>k</i>) The Karan subcaste belong to Bih&#257;r, and have two
local divisions, the Gayaw&#257;le from G&#257;ya, and the
Tirh&#363;tia from Tirh&#363;t.</p>
<p>(<i>l</i>) The Gaur K&#257;yasths, like the Gaur Br&#257;hmans and
R&#257;jp&#363;ts, apparently take their name from Gaur or Lakhnauti,
the old kingdom of Bengal. They have the Khare and D&#363;sre
subdivisions, and also three local groups named after Bengal, Delhi and
Budaun.</p>
<p>(<i>m</i>) The Nigum subcaste, whose name is apparently the same as
that of the Nikumbh R&#257;jp&#363;ts, are divided into two endogamous
groups, the Kad&#299;m or old, and the Un&#257;ya, or those coming from
Unao. Sometimes the Un&#257;ya are considered as a separate thirteenth
subcaste of mixed descent.</p>

<h3 class="main">8. Exogamy.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Educated K&#257;yasths now follow the standard rule of
exogamy, which prohibits marriage between persons within five degrees
of affinity on the female side and seven on the male. That is, persons
having a common grandparent on the female side cannot intermarry, while
for those related through males the prohibition extends a generation
further back. This is believed to be the meaning of the rule but it is
not quite clear. In Damoh the Sriv&#257;stab K&#257;yasths still retain
exogamous sections which are all named after places in the United
Provinces, as Ham&#299;rpur ki baink (section), Lucknowbar, K&#257;shi
ki P&#257;nde (a wise man of Ben&#257;res), Part&#257;bp&#363;ria,
Cawnpore-bar, Sult&#257;npuria and so on. They say that the ancestors
of these sections were families who came from the above places in
northern India, and settled in Damoh; here they came to be known by the
places from which they had immigrated, and so founded new exogamous
sections. A man cannot marry in his own section, or that of his mother
or grandmother. In the Central Provinces a man may marry two sisters,
but in northern India this is prohibited.</p>

href="#pb419" name="pb419">419</a>]</span>Provinces. However, in Damoh
it is said that a sum of Rs. 200 is paid to the bridegroom&rsquo;s
family. The marriage ceremony is performed according to the proper
ritual for the highest or Brahma form of marriage recognised by Manu
with Vedic texts. When the bridegroom arrives at the bride&rsquo;s
house he is given sherbet to drink. It is said that he then stands on a
pestle, and the bride&rsquo;s mother throws wheat-flour balls to the
four points of the compass, and shows the bridegroom a miniature
plough, a grinding pestle, a churning-staff and an arrow, and pulls his
nose. The bridegroom&rsquo;s struggles to prevent his mother-in-law
pulling his nose are the cause of much merriment, while the two parties
afterwards have a fight for the footstool on which he stands.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14133src" href="#xd21e14133" name=
"xd21e14133src">37</a> An image of a cow in flour is then brought, and
the bridegroom pierces its nostrils with a little stick of gold.
K&#257;yasths do not pierce the nostrils of bullocks themselves, but
these rites perhaps recall their dependence on agriculture in their
capacity of village accountants.</p>
<p>After the wedding the bridegroom&rsquo;s father takes various kinds
of fruit, as almonds, dates and raisins, and fills the bride&rsquo;s
lap with them four times, finally adding a cocoanut and a rupee. This
is a ceremony to induce fertility, and the cocoanut perhaps represents
a child.</p>

of the trees, he wished that he might die.</p>
<p class="line">Bharat ran after his brother with naked feet.</p>
<p class="line">He said, &lsquo;Oh brother, you are going to the
forest, to whom do you give the kingdom of Oudh?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">R&#257;ma said, &lsquo;When fourteen years have passed
away I shall come back from the jungles. Till then I give the kingdom
to you.&rsquo;</p>

R&#257;dha with her maidens was bathing in the river when Krishna stole
all their clothes and climbed up a tree with them. Girdh&#257;ri is a
name of Krishna:</p>

<p class="first">Polygamy is permitted but is seldom resorted to,
except for the sake of offspring. Neither widow-marriage nor divorce
are recognised, and either a girl or married woman is expelled from the
caste if detected in a <i>liaison</i>. A man may keep a woman of
another caste if he does not eat from her hand nor permit her to eat in
the <i>chauk</i> or purified place where he and his family take their
meals. The practice of keeping women was formerly common but has now
been largely suppressed. Women of all castes were kept except
Br&#257;hmans and K&#257;yasths. Illegitimate children were known as
Dogle or Sur&#257;it and called K&#257;yasths, ranking as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name="pb421">421</a>]</span>an
inferior group of the caste. And it is not unlikely that in the past
the descendants of such irregular unions have been admitted to the
D&#363;sre or lower branch of the different subcastes.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the seventh month of a woman&rsquo;s pregnancy
a dinner is given to the caste-fellows and songs are sung. After this
occasion the woman must not go outside her own village, nor can she go
to draw water from a well or to bathe in a tank. She can only go into
the street or to another house in her own village.</p>
<p>On the sixth day after a birth a dinner is given to the caste and
songs are sung. The women bring small silver coins or rupees and place
them in the mother&rsquo;s lap. The occasion of the first appearance of
the signs of maturity in a girl is not observed at all if she is in her
father&rsquo;s house. But if she has gone to her father-in-law&rsquo;s
house, she is dressed in new clothes, her hair after being washed is
tied up, and she is seated in the <i>chauk</i> or purified space, while
the women come and sing songs.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The K&#257;yasths venerate the ordinary Hindu deities.
They worship Chitragupta, their divine ancestor, at weddings and at the
Holi and Diw&#257;li festivals. Twice a year they venerate the pen and
ink, the implements of their profession, to which they owe their great
success. The patw&#257;ris in Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d formerly received
small fees, known as <i>diw&#257;t p&#363;ja</i>, from the cultivators
for worshipping the ink-bottle on their behalf, presumably owing to the
idea that, if neglected, it might make a malicious mistake in the
record of their rights.</p>

<p class="first">The dead are burnt, and the proper offerings are made
on the anniversaries, according to the prescribed Hindu ritual.
K&#257;yasth names usually end in Pras&#257;d, Singh, Baksh, Sewak, and
L&#257;la in the Central Provinces. L&#257;la, which is a term of
endearment, is often employed as a synonym for the caste. D&#257;da or
uncle is a respectful term of address for K&#257;yasths. Two names are
usually given to a boy, one for ceremonial and the other for ordinary
use.</p>
<p>The K&#257;yasths will take food cooked with water from
Br&#257;hmans, and that cooked without water (<i>pakki</i>) from
R&#257;jp&#363;ts and Banias. Some Hindust&#257;ni Br&#257;hmans, as
well <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422</a>]</span>as Khatris and certain classes of Banias, will
take <i>pakki</i> food from K&#257;yasths. K&#257;yasths of different
subcastes will sometimes also take it from each other. They will give
the huqqa with the reed in to members of their own subcaste, and
without the reed to any K&#257;yasth. The caste eat the flesh of goats,
sheep, fish, and birds. They were formerly somewhat notorious for
drinking freely, but a great reform has been effected in this respect
by the community itself through the agency of their caste conference,
and many are now total abstainers.</p>

their profession of writing and say that the son of a K&#257;yasth

Bhattach&#257;rya, <i>Hindu Castes and Sects</i>, p. 177. It is true
that Dr. Bhattach&#257;rya states that the K&#257;yasths were also
largely employed under the Hindu kings of Bengal, but he gives no
authority for this. The Gaur K&#257;yasths also claim that the Sena
kings of Bengal were of their caste, but considering that these kings
were looked on as spiritual heads of the country and one of them laid
down rules for the structure and intermarriage of the Br&#257;hman
caste, it is practically impossible that they could have been
K&#257;yasths. The Muhammadan conquest of Bengal took place at an early
period, and very little detail is known about the preceding Hindu
dynasties.</p>

They numbered 170,000 persons in 1911. The Kewats or Kaibarttas, as
they are called in Bengal, are the modern representatives of the
Kaivartas, a caste mentioned in Hindu classical literature. Sir H.
Risley explains the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423"
name="pb423">423</a>]</span>origin of the name as follows:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14309src" href="#xd21e14309" name=
"xd21e14309src">2</a> &ldquo;Concerning the origin of the name
Kaibartta there has been considerable difference of opinion. Some
derive it from <i>ka</i>, water, and <i>vartta</i>, livelihood; but
Lassen says that the use of <i>ka</i> in this sense is extremely
unusual in early Sanskrit, and that the true derivation is Kivarta, a
corruption of Kimvarta, meaning a person following a low or degrading
occupation. This, he adds, would be in keeping with the pedigree
assigned to the caste in Manu, where the Kaivarta, also known as
M&#257;rgava or D&#257;sa, is said to have been begotten by a
Nish&#257;da father and an Ayogavi mother, and to subsist by his labour
in boats. On the other hand, the Br&#257;hma-Vaivarta Pur&#257;na gives
the Kaibartta a Kshatriya father and a Vaishya mother, a far more
distinguished parentage; for the Ayogavi having been born from a
S&#363;dra father and a Vaishya mother is classed as <i>pratiloma</i>,
begotten against the hair, or in the inverse order of the precedence of
the castes.&rdquo; The Kewats are a mixed caste. Mr. Crooke says that
they merge on one side into the Mall&#257;hs and on the other into the
Binds. In the Central Provinces their two principal subdivisions are
the Laria and Uriya, or the residents of the Chhatt&#299;sgarh and
Sambalpur plains respectively. The Larias are further split up into the
Larias proper, the Kosbonwas, who grow <i>kosa</i> or tasar silk
cocoons, and the Binjhw&#257;rs and Dhuris (grain-parchers). The
Binjhw&#257;rs are a Hinduised group of the Baiga tribe, and in
Bhand&#257;ra they have become a separate Hindu caste, dropping the
first letter of the name, and being known as Injhw&#257;r. The
Binjhw&#257;r Kewats are a group of the same nature. The Dhuris are
grain-parchers, and there is a separate Dhuri caste; but as
grain-parching is also a traditional occupation of the Kewats, the
Dhuris may be an offshoot from them. The Kewats are so closely
connected with the Dh&#299;mars that it is difficult to make any
distinction; in Chhatt&#299;sgarh it is said that the Dh&#299;mars will
not act as ferrymen, while the Kewats will not grow or sell
<i>sing&#257;ra</i> or water-nut. The Dh&#299;mars worship their
fishing-nets on the Akti day, which the Kewats will not do. Both the
Kewats and Dh&#299;mars are almost certainly derived from the primitive
tribes. The Kewats say that formerly the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb424" href="#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>Hindus would not take
water from them; but on one occasion during his exile R&#257;ma came to
them and asked them to ferry him across a river; before doing so they
washed his feet and drank the water, and since that time the Hindus
have considered them pure and take water from their hands. This story
has no doubt been invented to explain the fact that Br&#257;hmans will
take water from the non-Aryan Kewats, the custom having in reality been
adopted as a convenience on account of their employment as
palanquin-bearers and indoor servants. But in Saugor, where they are
not employed as servants, and also grow <i>san</i>-hemp, their position
is distinctly lower and no high caste will take water from them.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Exogamous divisions and marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste have also a number of exogamous groups,
generally named after plants or animals, or bearing some nickname given
to the reputed founder. Instances of the first class are T&#363;ma, a
gourd, Kars&#257;yal, a deer, Bhalwa, a bear, Ghughu, an owl, and so
on. Members of such a sept abstain from injuring the animal after which
the sept is named or eating its flesh; those of the T&#363;ma sept
worship a gourd with offerings of milk and a cocoanut at the Holi
festival. Instances of titular names are Garhtod, one who destroyed a
fort, Jhagarha quarrelsome, Dehri priest, K&#257;la black, and so on.
One sept is named R&#257;wat, its founder having probably belonged to
the grazier caste. Members of this sept must not visit the temple of
Mah&#257;deo at R&#257;jim during the annual fair, but give no
explanation of the prohibition. Others are the Ahira, also from the
Ah&#299;r (herdsman) caste; the Rautele, which is the name of a
subdivision of Kols and other tribes; and the Sonw&#257;ni or
&lsquo;gold water&rsquo; sept, which is often found among the primitive
tribes. In some localities these three have now developed into separate
subcastes, marrying among themselves; and if any of their members
become Kab&#299;rpanthis, the others refuse to eat and intermarry with
them. The marriage of members of the same sept is prohibited, and also
the union of first cousins. Girls are generally married under ten years
of age, but if a suitable husband cannot be found for a daughter, the
parents will make her over to any member of the caste who offers
himself on condition that he bears the expenses of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>marriage. In Sambalpur she is married to a
flower. Sir H. Risley notes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14346src" href=
"#xd21e14346" name="xd21e14346src">3</a> the curious fact that in
Bih&#257;r it is deemed less material that the bridegroom should be
older than the bride than that he should be taller. &ldquo;This point
is of the first importance, and is ascertained by actual measurement.
If the boy shorter than the girl, or if his height is exactly the same
as hers, it is believed that the union of the two would bring ill-luck,
and the match is at once broken off.&rdquo; The marriage is celebrated
in the customary manner by walking round the sacred pole, after which
the bridegroom marks the forehead of the bride seven times with
vermilion, parts her hair with a comb, and then draws her cloth over
her head. The last act signifies that the bride has become a married
woman, as a girl never covers her head. In Bengal<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14351src" href="#xd21e14351" name="xd21e14351src">4</a> a drop of
blood is drawn from the fingers of the bride and bridegroom and mixed
with rice, and each eats the rice containing the blood of the other.
The anointing with vermilion is probably a substitute for this.
Widow-remarriage and divorce are permitted. In Sambalpur a girl who is
left a widow under ten years of age is remarried with full rites as a
virgin.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Social customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kewats worship the ordinary Hindu deities and
believe that a special goddess, Chaur&#257;si Devi, dwells in their
boats and keeps them from sinking. She is propitiated at the beginning
of the rains and in times of flood, and an image of her is painted on
their boats. They bury the dead, laying the corpse with the feet to the
south, while some clothes, cotton, til and salt are placed in the
grave, apparently as a provision for the dead man&rsquo;s soul. They
worship their ancestors at intervals on a Monday or a Saturday with an
offering of a fowl. As is usual in Chhatt&#299;sgarh, their rules as to
food are very lax, and they will eat both fowls and pork. Nevertheless
Br&#257;hmans will take water at their hands and eat the rice and gram
which they have parched. The caste consider fishing to have been their
original occupation, and tell a story to the effect that their
ancestors saved the deity in their boat on the occasion of the Deluge,
and in return were given the power of catching three or four times
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name=
"pb426">426</a>]</span>as many fish as ordinary persons in the same
space of time. Some of them parch gram and rice, and others act as
coolies and <i>banghy</i>-bearers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14369src"
href="#xd21e14369" name="xd21e14369src">5</a> Kewats are usually in
poor circumstances, but they boast that the town of Bil&#257;spur is
named after Bil&#257;sa Keotin, a woman of their caste. She was
married, but was sought after by the king of the country, so she held
out her cloth to the sun, calling on him to set it on fire, and was
burnt alive, preserving her virtue. Her husband burnt himself with her,
and the pair ascended to heaven. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427"

<p class="first"><b>Khairw&#257;r</b>, <b>Kharw&#257;r</b>,
<b>Khaira</b>, <b>Khairwa</b>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14456src"
href="#xd21e14456" name="xd21e14456src">1</a>&mdash;A primitive tribe
of the Chota N&#257;gpur plateau and Bih&#257;r. Nearly 20,000
Khairw&#257;rs are now under the jurisdiction of the Central Provinces,
of whom two-thirds belong to the recently acquired Sarg&#363;ja State,
and the remainder to the adjoining States and the Bil&#257;spur
District. A few hundred Khairw&#257;rs or Khairwas are also returned
from the Damoh District in the Bundelkhand country. Colonel Dalton
considers the Khairw&#257;rs to be closely connected with the Cheros.
He relates that the Cheros, once dominant in Gorakhpur and
Sh&#257;h&#257;b&#257;d, were expelled from these tracts many centuries
ago by the Gorkhas and other tribes, and came into Pal&#257;mau.
&ldquo;It is said that the Pal&#257;mau population then consisted of
Kharw&#257;rs, Gonds, M&#257;rs, Korwas, Parheyas and Kis&#257;ns. Of
these the Kharw&#257;rs were the people of most consideration. The
Cheros conciliated them and allowed them to remain in peaceful
possession of the hill tracts bordering on Sarg&#363;ja; all the Cheros
of note who assisted in the expedition obtained military service grants
of land, which they still retain. It is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb428" href="#pb428" name="pb428">428</a>]</span>popularly asserted
that at the commencement of the Chero rule in Pal&#257;mau they
numbered twelve thousand families and the Kharw&#257;rs eighteen
thousand, and if an individual of one or the other is asked to what
tribe he belongs, he will say not that he is a Chero or a Kharw&#257;r,
but that he belongs to the twelve thousand or the eighteen thousand, as
the case may be. Intermarriages between Chero and Kharw&#257;r families
have taken place. A relative of the Pal&#257;mau R&#257;ja married a
sister of Manin&#257;th Singh, R&#257;ja of R&#257;mgarh, and this is
among themselves an admission of identity of origin, as both claiming
to be R&#257;jp&#363;ts they could not intermarry till it was proved to
the satisfaction of the family priest that the parties belonged to the
same class.... The R&#257;jas of R&#257;mgarh and Jashpur are members
of this tribe, who have nearly succeeded in obliterating their Turanian
traits by successive intermarriages with Aryan families. The Jashpur
R&#257;ja is wedded to a lady of pure R&#257;jp&#363;t blood, and by
liberal dowries has succeeded in obtaining a similar union for three of
his daughters. It is a costly ambition, but there is no doubt that the
liberal infusion of fresh blood greatly improves the Kharw&#257;r
physique.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14462src" href=
"#xd21e14462" name="xd21e14462src">2</a> This passage demonstrates the
existence of a close connection between the Cheros and Khairw&#257;rs.
Elsewhere Colonel Dalton connects the Sant&#257;ls with the
Khairw&#257;rs as follows:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14467src" href=
"#xd21e14467" name="xd21e14467src">3</a> &ldquo;A wild goose coming
from the great ocean alighted at Ahiri Pipri and there laid two eggs.
From these two eggs a male and female were produced, who were the
parents of the Sant&#257;l race. From Ahiri Pipri our (Sant&#257;l)
ancestors migrated to Hara Dutti, and there they greatly increased and
multiplied and were called Kharw&#257;r.&rdquo; This also affords some
reason for supposing that the Khairw&#257;rs are an offshoot of the
Cheros and Sant&#257;ls. Mr. Crooke remarks, &ldquo;That in
M&#299;rz&#257;pur the people themselves derive their name either from
their occupation as makers of catechu (<i>khair</i>) or on account of
their emigration from some place called Khair&#257;garh, regarding
which there is a great difference of opinion. If the Sant&#257;l
tradition is to be accepted, Khair&#257;garh is the place of that name
in the Haz&#257;rib&#257;gh District; but the M&#299;rz&#257;pur
tradition seems to point to some locality in the south or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name=
"pb429">429</a>]</span>west, in which case Khair&#257;garh may be
identified with the most important of the Chhatt&#299;sgarh Feudatory
States, or with the pargana of that name in the Allah&#257;b&#257;d
District.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14477src" href=
"#xd21e14477" name="xd21e14477src">4</a> According to their own
traditions in Chota N&#257;gpur, Sir H. Risley states that,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14482src" href="#xd21e14482" name=
"xd21e14482src">5</a> &ldquo;The Kharw&#257;rs declare their original
seat to have been the fort of Roht&#257;s, so called as having been the
chosen abode of Rohit&#257;swa, son of Har&#299;schandra, of the family
of the Sun. From this ancient house they also claim descent, calling
themselves S&#363;rajvansis, and wearing the <i>Janeo</i> or caste
thread distinguishing the R&#257;jp&#363;ts. A less flattering
tradition makes them out to be the offspring of a marriage between a
Kshatriya man and a Bhar woman contracted in the days of King Ben, when
distinctions of caste were abolished and men might marry whom they
would.&rdquo; A somewhat similar story of themselves is told by the
tribe in the B&#257;mra State. Here they say that their original
ancestors were the Sun and a daughter of Lakshmi, the goddess of
wealth, who lived in the town of Sara. She was very beautiful and the
Sun desired her, and began blowing into a conch-shell to express his
passion. While the girl was gaping at the sight and sound, a drop of
the spittle fell into her mouth and impregnated her. Subsequently a son
was born from her arm and a daughter from her thigh, who were known as
Bhujbalrai and Janghrai.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14490src" href=
"#xd21e14490" name="xd21e14490src">6</a> Bhujbalrai was given great
strength by the Sun, and he fought with the people of the country, and
became king of R&#257;thgarh. But in consequence of this he and his
family grew proud, and Lakshmi determined to test them whether they
were worthy of the riches she had given them. So she came in the guise
of a beggar to the door, but was driven away without alms. On this she
cursed them, and said that their descendants, the Khairw&#257;rs,
should always be poor, and should eke out a scanty subsistence from the
forests. And in consequence the Khairw&#257;rs have ever since been
engaged in boiling wood for catechu. Mr. <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e14499" title="Source: Hira">H&#299;ra</span> L&#257;l identifies
the R&#257;thgarh of this story with the tract of R&#257;th in the
north of the Raigarh <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430"
name="pb430">430</a>]</span>State and the town of Sara, where
Lakshmi&rsquo;s daughter lived and her children were born, with Saria

<h3 class="main">2. Its origin.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the information available as to the past history of
the tribe it seems probable that the Khairw&#257;rs may, as suggested
by Sir H. Risley, be an offshoot from some other group. The most
probable derivation of the name seems to be from the <i>khair</i> or
catechu tree (<i>Acacia catechu</i>); and it may be supposed that it
was the adoption as a calling of the making of catechu which led to
their differentiation. Mr. Crooke derives their name either from the
<i>khair</i> tree or a place called Khair&#257;garh; but this latter
name almost certainly means &lsquo;The fort of the <i>khair</i>
trees.&rsquo; The Khairw&#257;s or Khairw&#257;rs of the Kaimur hills,
who are identified by Colonel Dalton and in the India Census of 1901
with the Khairw&#257;rs of Chota N&#257;gpur, are certainly named after
the tree; they are generally recognised as being Gonds who have taken
to the business of boiling catechu, and are hence distinguished, being
a little looked down upon by other Gonds. Mr. Crooke describes them in
M&#299;rz&#257;pur as &ldquo;Admittedly a compound of various jungle
tribes who have taken to this special occupation; while according to
another account they are the offspring of the Saharias or Saonrs, with
whom their sept names are said to be identical.&rdquo; He also
identifies them with the Kathk&#257;ris of Bombay, whose name means
&lsquo;makers of <i>katha</i> or prepared catechu.&rsquo; The
Khairw&#257;rs of Chota N&#257;gpur have everywhere a subdivision which
makes catechu, this being known as Khairch&#363;ra in the Central
Provinces, Khairi in Bengal and Khairaha in the United Provinces. This
group is looked down upon by the other Khairw&#257;rs, who consider
their occupation to be disreputable and do not marry with them.
Possibly the preparation of catechu, like basket- and mat-making, is
despised as being a profession practised by primitive dwellers in
forests, and so those Khairw&#257;rs who have become more civilised are
now anxious to disclaim it. Sir H. Risley has several times pointed out
the indeterminate nature of the constitution of the Chota N&#257;gpur
tribes, between several of whom intermarriage is common. And it seems
certain that the tribes as we know them now must have been
differentiated from one or more common stocks much in the same fashion
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>as castes, though rather by the influence of
local settlement than by differences of occupation, and at a much
earlier date. And on the above facts it seems likely that the
Khairw&#257;rs of Chota N&#257;gpur are an occupational offshoot of the
Cheros and Sant&#257;ls, as those of the Kaimur hills are of the Gonds
and Savars.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Tribal subdivisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Colonel Dalton states that the tribe had four
subdivisions, Bhogta, Mahto, R&#257;wat and M&#257;njhi. Of these Mahto
simply means a village headman, and is used as a title by many castes
and tribes; R&#257;wat is a term meaning chief, and is in common use as
a title; and M&#257;njhi too is a title, being specially applied to
boatmen, and also means a village headman among the Sant&#257;ls. These
divisions, too, afford some reason for considering the tribe to be a
mixed group. Other occupational subtribes are recorded by Sir H.
Risley, and are found in the Central Provinces, but these apparently
have grown up since Colonel Dalton&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>The most important group in Bengal are the Bhogtas, who are found,
says Colonel Dalton, &ldquo;In the hills of Pal&#257;mau, skirting
Sarg&#363;ja, in Tori and Bh&#257;nwar Pah&#257;r of Chota N&#257;gpur
and other places. They have always had an indifferent reputation. The
head of the clan in Pal&#257;mau was a notorious freebooter, who, after
having been outlawed and successfully evaded every attempt to capture
him, obtained a <i>j&#257;g&#299;r</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14536src" href="#xd21e14536" name="xd21e14536src">7</a> on his
surrendering and promising to keep the peace. He kept to his engagement
and died in fair repute, but his two sons could not resist the
opportunity afforded by the disturbances of 1857&ndash;58. After giving
much trouble they were captured; one was hanged, the other transported
for life and the estate was confiscated.&rdquo; Mr. Crooke notes that
the Khairw&#257;rs since adopting Hinduism performed human sacrifices

<p>In the Central Provinces there is a group known as S&#363;rajvansi
or Descendants of the Sun, or Janeodh&#257;ri, &lsquo;Those who wear
the sacred thread.&rsquo; This is the aristocratic division of the
caste, to which the chiefs and zam&#299;nd&#257;rs belong, and
according to the usual practice they have consolidated their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432" name=
"pb432">432</a>]</span>higher position by marrying only among
themselves. Other groups are the Du&#257;lbandhi, who say that they are
so called because they make a livelihood by building the earthen
<i>diw&#257;ls</i> or walls for houses and yards; but in
M&#299;rz&#257;pur they derive the name from <i>du&#257;l</i>, a
leather belt which is supposed to have been the uniform of their
forefathers when serving as soldiers.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14554src" href="#xd21e14554" name="xd21e14554src">9</a> The
P&#257;tbandhi or silk-makers, according to their own story, are thus
named because their ancestors were once very rich and wore silk; but a
more probable hypothesis is that they were rearers of tasar silk
cocoons. The Beld&#257;r or Matkora work as navvies, and are also known
as Kawarvansi or &lsquo;Descendants of the Kawars,&rsquo; another tribe
of the locality; and last come the Khairch&#363;ra, who take their name
from the <i>khair</i> tree and are catechu-makers.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Exogamous septs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tribe have a large number of exogamous groups
named after plants and animals. Members of the mouse, tortoise, parrot,
pig, monkey, vulture, banyan tree and date-palm septs worship their
totem animal or tree, and when they find the dead body of the animal
they throw away an earthen cooking-pot to purify themselves, as is done
when a member of the family dies. Those of the <i>Dh&#257;n</i> (rice),
<i>Non</i> (salt), <i>Dila</i> (plough) and <i>Dhenki</i> (rice
pounding-lever) septs cannot dispense with the use of these objects,
but make a preliminary obeisance before employing them. Those of the
K&#257;nsi sept sprinkle water mixed with <i>k&#257;ns</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e14582src" href="#xd21e14582" name=
"xd21e14582src">10</a> grass over the bride and bridegroom at the
marriage ceremony, and those of the <i>Chandan</i> or sandalwood sept
apply sandal-paste to their foreheads. They cannot clearly explain the
meaning of these observances, but some of them have a vague idea that
they are descended from the totem object.</p>

<h3 class="main">5. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage is either infant or adult, and in the latter
case a girl is not disposed of without her consent. A bride-price
varying from five to ten rupees is paid, and in the case of a girl
given to a widower the amount is doubled. The Hindu ceremonial has been
adopted for the wedding, and an auspicious day is fixed by a
Br&#257;hman. In Bengal Sir H. Risley notes that &ldquo;Remnants of
non-Aryan usage may be discerned in the marriage ceremony itself. Both
parties must first go through the form of marriage to a mango tree or
at least a branch of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433"
name="pb433">433</a>]</span>the tree; and must exchange blood mixed
with <i>sindur</i>, though in the final and binding act <i>sindur</i>
alone is smeared by the bridegroom upon the bride&rsquo;s forehead and
the parting of her hair.&rdquo; As has been pointed out by Mr. Crooke,
the custom of smearing vermilion on the bride&rsquo;s forehead is a
substitute for an earlier anointing with blood; just as the original
idea underlying the offering of a cocoanut was that of substitution for
a human head. In some cases blood alone is still used. Thus Sir H.
Risley notes that among the Birhors the marriage rite is performed by
drawing blood from the little fingers of the bride and bridegroom and
smearing it on each of them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14603src" href=
"#xd21e14603" name="xd21e14603src">11</a> The blood-covenant by which a
bride was admitted to her husband&rsquo;s sept by being smeared with
his blood is believed to have been a common rite among primitive
tribes.</p>

<h3 class="main">6. Disposal of the dead.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As a rule, the tribe bury the dead, though the Hindu
custom of cremation is coming into fashion among the well-to-do. Before
the interment they carry the corpse seven times round the grave, and it
is buried with the feet pointing to the north. They observe mourning
for ten days and abstain from animal food and liquor during that
period. A curious custom is reported from the Bil&#257;spur District,
where it is said that children cut a small piece of flesh from the
finger of a dead parent and swallow it, considering this as a requital
for the labour of the mother in having carried the child for nine
months in her womb. So in return they carry a piece of her flesh in
their bodies. But the correct explanation as given by Sir J. G. Frazer
is that they do it to prevent themselves from being haunted by the
ghosts of their parents. &ldquo;Thus Orestes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e14613src" href="#xd21e14613" name="xd21e14613src">12</a> after he
had gone mad from murdering his mother, recovered his wits by biting
off one of his own fingers; since his victim was his own mother it
might be supposed that the tasting of his own blood was the same as
hers; and the furies of his murdered mother, which had appeared black
to him before, appeared white as soon as he had mutilated himself in
this way. The Indians of Guiana believe that an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434</a>]</span>avenger of blood who has slain his man must go
mad unless he tastes the blood of his victim, the notion apparently
being that the ghost drives him crazy. A similar custom was observed by
the Maoris in battle. When a warrior had slain his foe in combat, he
tasted his blood, believing that this preserved him from the avenging
spirit (<i>atua</i>) of his victim; for they imagined that &lsquo;the
moment a slayer had tasted the blood of the slain, the dead man became
a part of his being and placed him under the protection of the
<i>atua</i> or guardian-spirit of the deceased.&rsquo; Some of the
North American Indians also drank the blood of their enemies in battle.
Strange as it may seem, this truly savage superstition exists
apparently in Italy to this day. There is a widespread opinion in
Calabria that if a murderer is to escape he must suck his
victim&rsquo;s blood from the reeking blade of the dagger with which he
did the deed.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">7. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The religion of the tribe is of the usual animistic
type. Colonel Dalton notes that they have, like the Kols, a village
priest, known as Pahan or Baiga. He is always one of the impure tribes,
a Bhuiya, a Kharw&#257;r or a Korwa, and he offers a great triennial
sacrifice of a buffalo in the sacred grove, or on a rock near the
village. The fact that the Khairw&#257;rs employed members of the Korwa
and Bhuiya tribes as their village priests may be taken to indicate
that the latter are the earlier residents of the country, and are on
this account employed by the Khairw&#257;rs as later arrivals for the
conciliation of the indigenous deities. Colonel Dalton states that the
Khairw&#257;rs made no prayers to any of the Hindu gods, but when in
great trouble they appealed to the sun. In the Central Provinces the
main body of the tribe, and particularly those who belong to the
landholding class, profess the Hindu religion.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Khairw&#257;rs have now also adopted the Hindu
rule of inheritance, and have abandoned the tribal custom which Sir H.
Risley records as existing in Bengal. &ldquo;Here the eldest son of the
senior wife, even if younger than one of the sons of the second wife,
inherits the entire property, subject to the obligation of providing
for all other legitimate children. If the inheritance consists of land,
the heir is expected to create separate maintenance grants in favour of
his younger <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=

<h3 class="main">9. The Khairwas of Damoh.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Khairwas or Khairw&#257;rs of the Kaimur hills are
derived, as already seen, from the Gonds and Savars, and therefore are
ethnologically a distinct group from those of the Chota N&#257;gpur
plateau, who have been described above. But as nearly every caste is
made up of diverse ethnological elements held together by the tie of a
common occupation, it does not seem worth while to treat these groups
separately. Colonel Dalton, who also identifies them with the main
tribe, records an interesting notice of them at an earlier
period:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14650src" href="#xd21e14650" name=
"xd21e14650src">14</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;There is in the seventh volume of the Asiatic Researches a
notice of the Kharw&#257;rs of the Kaimur hills in the
M&#299;rz&#257;pur District, to the north of the Son river, by Captain
J. P. Blunt, who in his journey from Chun&#257;r to Ellora in
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1794, met with them and describes them as
a very primitive tribe. He visited one of their villages consisting of
half a dozen poor huts, and though proceeding with the utmost caution,
unattended, to prevent alarm, the inhabitants fled at his approach. The
women were seen, assisted by the men, carrying off their children and
moving with speed to hide themselves in the woods. It was observed that
they were nearly naked, and the only articles of domestic use found in
the deserted huts were a few gourds for water-vessels, some bows and
arrows, and some fowls as wild as their masters. With great difficulty,
by the employment of Kols as mediators, some of the men were induced to
return. They were nearly naked, but armed with bows and arrows and a
hatchet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Damoh the Khairw&#257;rs are said to come from Panna State.
During the working season they live in temporary sheds in the forest,
and migrate from place to place as the supply of trees is exhausted.
Having cut down a tree they strip off the bark and cut the inner and
tender wood into small pieces, which are boiled for two or three days
until a thick black paste is obtained. From this the water is allowed
to drain off, and the residue is made into cakes and dried in the sun.
It is eaten in small pieces with betel-leaf and areca-nut. Duty is
levied by the Forest Department at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb436" href="#pb436" name="pb436">436</a>]</span>rate of a rupee per
<i>handi</i> or pot in which boiling is carried on. In Bombay various
superstitious observances are connected with the manufacture of
catechu; and Mr. Crooke quoted the following description of them from
the <i>Bombay Gazetteer</i>:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14670src" href=
"#xd21e14670" name="xd21e14670src">15</a> &ldquo;Every year on the day
after the Holi the ch&#363;lha ceremony takes place. In a trench seven
feet long by three, and about three deep, <i>khair</i> logs are
carefully stacked and closely packed till they stand in a heap about
three feet above ground. The pile is then set on fire and allowed to
burn to the level of the ground. The village sweeper breaks a cocoanut,
kills a couple of fowls and sprinkles a little liquor near the pile.
Then, after washing their feet, the sweeper and the village headman
walk barefoot hurriedly across the fire. After this strangers come to
fulfil vows, and giving one anna and a half cocoanut to the sweeper,
and the other half cocoanut to the headman, wash their feet, and
turning to the left, walk over the pile. The fire seems to cause none
of them any pain.&rdquo; The following description of the
Kathk&#257;ris as hunters of monkeys is also taken by Mr. Crooke from
the <i>Bombay Gazetteer</i>:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14686src" href=
"#xd21e14686" name="xd21e14686src">16</a> &ldquo;The Kathk&#257;ris
represent themselves as descended from the monkeys of R&#257;ma. Now
that their legitimate occupation of preparing catechu (<i>kath</i>) has
been interfered with, they subsist almost entirely by hunting, and
habitually kill and eat monkeys, shooting them with bows and arrows. In
order to approach within range they are obliged to have recourse to
stratagems, as the monkeys at once recognise them in their ordinary
costume. The ruse usually adopted is for one of the best shots to put
on a woman&rsquo;s robe (<i>s&#257;ri</i>), under the ample folds of
which he conceals his murderous weapons. Approaching the tree in which
the monkeys are seated, the sportsman affects the utmost unconcern, and
busies himself with the innocent occupation of picking up twigs and
leaves, and thus disarming suspicion he is enabled to get a
sufficiently close shot to render success a certainty.&rdquo;</p>

Risley remarks of the Khandaits:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14711src"
href="#xd21e14711" name="xd21e14711src">1</a> &ldquo;The caste is for
the most part, if not entirely, composed of Bhuiyas, whose true
affinities have been disguised under a functional name, while their
customs, their religion and in some cases even their complexion and
features have been modified by long contact with Hindus of relatively
pure Aryan descent. The ancient R&#257;jas of Orissa kept up large
armies and partitioned the land on strictly military tenures. These
armies consisted of various castes and races, the upper ranks being
officered by men of good Aryan descent, while the lower ones were
recruited from the low castes alike of the hills and the plains. In the
social system of Orissa, the <i>Sresta</i> or &lsquo;best&rsquo;
Khandaits rank next to the R&#257;jp&#363;ts, who have not the intimate
connection with the land which has helped to raise the Khandaits to
their present position.&rdquo; The Khandaits are thus like the
Mar&#257;thas, and the small body of Paiks in the northern Districts, a
caste formed from military service; and though recruited for the most
part originally from the Dravidian tribes, they have obtained a
considerable rise in status owing to their occupation and the
opportunity which has been afforded to many of them to become
landholders. The best Khandaits now aspire to R&#257;jp&#363;t rank,
while the bulk of them have the position of cultivators, from whom
Br&#257;hmans will take water, or a much higher one than they are
entitled to by descent. In<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14720src" href=
"#xd21e14720" name="xd21e14720src">2</a> the Central Provinces the
Khandaits have no subcastes, and only two <i>gotras</i> or clans, named
after the Kachhap or tortoise and the N&#257;gas or cobra respectively.
These divisions appear, however, to be nominal, and do not regulate
marriage, as to which the only rule observed is that persons whose
descent can be traced from the same parent should not marry each other.
Early marriage is usual, and if a girl arrives at adolescence without a
husband having been found for her, she goes through the ceremony of
wedlock with an arrow. Polygamy is permitted, but a person resorting to
it is looked down on and nicknamed Maipkhia or wife-eater. The
essential portion of the marriage ceremony is the <i>bandan</i> or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name=
"pb438">438</a>]</span>tying of the hands of the bride and bridegroom
together with <i>kusha</i> grass. The bridegroom must lift up the bride
and walk seven times round the marriage altar carrying her.
Widow-marriage and divorce are permitted in the Central Provinces, and
Br&#257;hmans are employed for religious and ceremonial purposes.

watchmen and field-labourers belonging to Bundelkhand, and found in the
Saugor, Damoh, Narsinghpur and Jubbulpore Districts. They numbered
nearly 13,000 in 1911. The Khang&#257;rs are also numerous in the
United Provinces. Hindu ingenuity has evolved various explanations of
the word Khang&#257;r, such as &lsquo;<i>khand</i>,&rsquo; a pit, and
&lsquo;<i>gar</i>,&rsquo; maker, digger, because the Khang&#257;r digs
holes in other people&rsquo;s houses for the purposes of theft. The

little doubt also that Bundelkhand was its original home. It may be
noted that the Munda tribe have a division called Khang&#257;r with
which the caste may have some connection. The Khang&#257;rs themselves
relate the following story of their origin. Their ancestors were
formerly the rulers of the fort and territory of Kur&#257;r in
Bundelkhand, when a Bundela R&#257;jp&#363;t came and settled there.
The Bundela had a very pretty daughter whom the Khang&#257;r R&#257;ja
demanded in marriage. The Bundela did not wish to give his daughter to
the Khang&#257;r, but could not refuse the R&#257;ja outright, so he
said that he would consent if all the Khang&#257;rs would agree to
adopt Bundela practices. This the Khang&#257;rs readily agreed to do,
and the Bundela thereupon invited them all to a wedding feast, and
having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440" name=
"pb440">440</a>]</span>summoned his companions and plied the
Khang&#257;rs with liquor until they were dead drunk, cut them all to
pieces. One pregnant woman only escaped by hiding in a field of
<i>kusum</i> or safflower,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14805src" href=
"#xd21e14805" name="xd21e14805src">2</a> and on this account the
Khang&#257;rs still venerate the <i>kusum</i> and will not wear cloths
dyed with saffron. She fled to the house of a Muhammadan eunuch or
Fak&#299;r, who gave her shelter and afterwards placed her with a
D&#257;ngi landowner. The Bundelas followed her up and came to the
house of the D&#257;ngi, who denied that the Khang&#257;r woman was
with him. The Bundelas then asked him to make all the women in his
house eat together to prove that none of them was the Khang&#257;rin,
on which the D&#257;ngi five times distributed the <i>maihar</i>, a
sacrificial cake which is only given to relations, to all the women of
the household including the Khang&#257;rin, and thus convinced the
Bundelas that she was not in the house. The woman who was thus saved
became the ancestor of the whole Khang&#257;r caste, and in memory of
this act the Khang&#257;rs and Nadia D&#257;ngis are still each bidden
to eat the <i>maihar</i> cake at the weddings of the other, or at least
so it is said; while the Fak&#299;rs, in honour of this great occasion
when one of their number acted as giver rather than receiver, do not
beg for alms at the wedding of a Khang&#257;r, but on the contrary
bring presents. The basis of the story, that the Khang&#257;rs were the
indigenous inhabitants of Bundelkhand and were driven out and
slaughtered by the immigrant Bundelas, may not improbably be
historically correct. It is also said that no Khang&#257;r is even now
allowed to enter the fort of Kur&#257;r, and that the spirit of the
murdered chief still haunts it; so that if a bed is placed there in the
evening with a tooth-stick, the tooth-stick will be split in the
morning as after use, and the bed will appear as if it had been slept
in.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14819src" href="#xd21e14819" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste has four subdivisions, named Rai, Mirdha or
Nak&#299;b, Karbal and Dah&#257;t. The Rai or royal Khang&#257;rs are
the highest group and practise hypergamy with families of the Mirdha
and Karbal groups, taking daughters from them in marriage but not
giving their daughters to them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441"
href="#pb441" name="pb441">441</a>]</span>The Mirdhas or Nak&#299;bs
are so called because they act as mace-bearers and form the bodyguard
of princes. Very few, if any, are to be found in the Central Provinces.
The Karbal are supposed to be especially valorous. The Dah&#257;ts have
developed into a separate caste called Dahait, and are looked down on
by all the other divisions as they keep pigs. The caste is also divided
into numerous exogamous septs, all of which are totemistic; and the
members of the sept usually show veneration to the object from which
the sept takes its name. Some of the names of septs are as follows:
Bachhiy&#257; from <i>bachhr&#257;</i> a calf; Barha from
<i>bar&#257;h</i> a pig, this sept worshipping the pig; Belgotia from
the <i>bel</i> tree; Chandan from the sandalwood tree; Chirai from
<i>chiriya</i> a bird, this sept revering sparrows; Ghurgotia from
<i>ghora</i> a horse (members of this sept touch the feet of a horse
before mounting it and do not ride on a horse in wedding processions);
Guae from the iguana; Hanum&#257;n from the monkey god; H&#257;thi from
the elephant; Kasgotia from <i>k&#257;nsa</i> bell-metal (members of
this sept do not use vessels of bell-metal on ceremonial occasions nor
sell them); Mahiyar from <i>maihar</i> fried cakes (members of this
sept do not use <i>gh&#299;</i> at their weddings and may not sell
<i>gh&#299;</i> by weight though they may sell it by measure);
<i>San</i> after <i>san</i>-hemp (members of this sept place pieces of
hemp near their family god); S&#257;ndgotia from <i>s&#257;nd</i> a
bullock; T&#257;mbagotia from <i>t&#257;mba</i> copper; and Vishnu from
the god of that name, whom the sept worship. The names of 31 septs in
all are reported and there are probably others. The fact that two or
three septs are named after Hindu deities may be noticed as
peculiar.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The marriage of members of the same sept is prohibited
and also that of first cousins. Girls are usually married at about ten
years of age, the parents of the girl having to undertake the duty of
finding a husband. The ceremonial in vogue in the northern Districts is
followed throughout, an astrologer being consulted to ascertain that
the horoscopes of the pair are favourable, and a Br&#257;hman employed
to draw up the <i>lagan</i> or auspicious paper fixing the date of the
marriage. The bridegroom is dressed in a yellow gown and over-cloth,
with trousers of red chintz, red shoes, and a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442" name=
"pb442">442</a>]</span>marriage-crown of date-palm leaves. He has the
silver ornaments usually worn by women on his neck, as the
<i>khangw&#257;ri</i> or silver ring, and the <i>hamel</i> or necklace
of rupees. In order to avert the evil eye he carries a dagger or
nutcracker, and a smudge of lampblack is made on his forehead to
disfigure him and thus avert the evil eye, which it is thought would
otherwise be too probably attracted by his exquisitely beautiful
appearance in his wedding garments. The binding portion of the ceremony
is the <i>bh&#257;nwar</i> or walking round the sacred post of the
<i>munga</i> tree (<i>Moringa pterygosperma</i>). This is done six
times by the couple, the bridegroom leading, and they then make a
seventh turn round the <i>bedi</i> or sacrificial fire. If the bride is
a child this seventh round is omitted at the marriage and performed at
the <i>Dusarta</i> or going-away ceremony. After the marriage the
<i>haldi</i> ceremony takes place, the father of the bridegroom being
dressed in women&rsquo;s clothes; he then dances with the mother of the
bride, while they throw turmeric mixed with water over each other.
Widow-marriage is allowed, and the widow may marry anybody in the
caste; the ceremony consists in the placing of bangles on her wrist,
and is always performed at night, a Wednesday being usually selected. A
feast must afterwards be given to the caste-fellows. Divorce is also
permitted, and may be effected at the instance of either party in the
presence of the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee. When a
husband divorces his wife he must give a feast.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Khang&#257;rs worship the usual Hindu deities and
especially venerate D&#363;lha Deo, a favourite household godling in
the northern Districts. Pachgara Deo is a deity who seems to have been
created to commemorate the occasion when the D&#257;ngi distributed the
marriage cakes five times to the fugitive ancestress of the caste. His
cult is now on the decline, but some still consider him the most
important deity of all, and it is said that no Khang&#257;r will tell
an untruth after having sworn by this god. Children dying unmarried and
persons dying of leprosy or smallpox are buried, while others are
buried or burnt according as the family can afford the more expensive
rite of cremation or not. As among other castes a corpse must not be
burnt between sunset and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href=
"#pb443" name="pb443">443</a>]</span>sunrise, as it is believed that
this would cause the soul to be born blind in the next birth. Nor must
the corpse be wrapped in stitched clothes, as in that case the child in
which it is reincarnated would be born with its arms and legs
entangled. The corpse is laid on its back and some <i>gh&#299;</i>,
til, barley cakes and sandalwood, if available, are placed on the body.
The soul of the deceased is believed to haunt the house for three days,
and each night a lamp and a little water in an earthen pot are placed
ready for it. When cremation takes place the ashes are collected on the
third day and the burning ground is cleaned with cowdung and sprinkled
with milk, mustard and salt, in order that a cow may lick over the
place and the soul of the deceased may thus find more easy admission
into <i>Baikunth</i> or heaven. Well-to-do persons take the bones of
the dead to the Ganges, a few from the different parts of the body
being selected and tied round the bearer&rsquo;s neck. Mourning is
usually only observed for three days.</p>

<h3 class="main">5. Social status.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Khang&#257;rs do not admit outsiders into the
caste, except children born of a Khang&#257;r father and a mother
belonging to one of the highest castes. A woman going wrong with a man
of another caste is finally expelled, but <i>liaisons</i> within the
caste may be atoned for by the usual penalty of a feast. The caste eat
flesh and drink liquor but abjure fowls, pork and beef. They will take
food cooked without water from Banias, Sun&#257;rs and Tameras, but
<i>katchi roti</i> only from the Br&#257;hmans who act as their
priests. Such Br&#257;hmans are received on terms of equality by others
of the caste. Khang&#257;rs bathe daily, and their women take off their
outer cloth to eat food, because this is not washed every day. Food
cooked with water must be consumed in the <i>chauka</i> or place where
it is prepared, and not carried outside the house. Men of the caste
often have the suffix Singh after their names in imitation of the
R&#257;jp&#363;ts. Although their social observances are thus in some
respects strict, the status of the caste is low, and Br&#257;hmans do
not take water from them.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=

&ldquo;The Khang&#257;r is strong only when he possesses a
<i>khunta</i> (a pointed iron rod to break through the wall of a
house).&rdquo; &lsquo;The Sun&#257;r and the Khang&#257;r only flourish
together&rsquo;; because the Sun&#257;r acts as a receiver of the
property stolen by the Khang&#257;r. They are said to have had
different ways of breaking into a house, those who got through the roof
being called <i>chhappartor</i>, while others who dug through the side
walls were known as <i>khonp&#257;phor</i>. They have now, however,
generally relinquished their criminal practices and settled down to

href="#xd21e15040" name="xd21e15040src">1</a>&mdash;A primitive
Kolarian tribe, of which about 900 persons were returned from the
Central Provinces in 1911. They belong to the Bil&#257;spur District
and the Jashpur and Raigarh States. The Kharias are one of the most
backward of the Kolarian tribes, and appear to be allied to the Mundas
and Savars. Colonel Dalton says of them: &ldquo;In the Chota
N&#257;gpur estate they are found in large communities, and the Kharias
belonging to these communities are far more civilised than those who
live apart. Their best settlements lie near the southern Koel river,
which stream they venerate as the Sant&#257;ls do the D&#257;mudar, and
into it they throw the ashes of their dead.&rdquo; Chota N&#257;gpur is
the home of the Kharias, and their total strength is over a lakh. They
are found elsewhere only in Assam, where they have probably migrated to
the tea-gardens.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">2. Legend of origin.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kharia legend of origin resembles that of the
Mundas, and tends to show that they are an elder branch of that tribe.
They say that a child was born to a woman in the jungle, and she left
it to fetch a basket in which to carry it home. On her return she saw a
cobra spreading its hood <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href=
"#pb446" name="pb446">446</a>]</span>over the child to protect it from
the sun. On this account the child was called N&#257;gvansi (of the
race of the cobra), and became the ancestor of the N&#257;gvansi
R&#257;jas of Chota N&#257;gpur. The Kharias say this child had an
elder brother, and the two brothers set out on a journey, the younger
riding a horse and the elder carrying a <i>k&#257;war</i> or banghy
with their luggage. When they came to Chota N&#257;gpur the younger was
made king, on which the elder brother also asked for a share of the
inheritance. The people then put two caskets before him and asked him
to choose one. One of the caskets contained silver and the other only
some earth. The elder brother chose that which contained earth, and on
this he was told that the fate of himself and his descendants would be
to till the soil, and carry banghys as he had been doing. The Kharias
say that they are descended from the elder brother, while the younger
was the ancestor of the N&#257;gvansi R&#257;jas, who are really
Mundas. They say that they can never enter the house of the
N&#257;gvansi R&#257;jas because they stand in the relation of elder
brother-in-law to the R&#257;nis, who are consequently prohibited from
looking on the face of a Kharia. This story is exactly like that of the
Parjas in connection with the R&#257;jas of Bastar. And as the Parjas
are probably an older branch of the Gonds, who were reduced to
subjection by the subsequent R&#257;j-Gond immigrants under the
ancestors of the Bastar R&#257;jas, so it seems a reasonable hypothesis
that the Kharias stood in a similar relationship to the Mundas or Kols.
This theory derives some support from the fact that, according to Sir
H. Risley, the Mundas will take daughters in marriage from the Kharias,
but will not give their daughters to them, and the Kharias speak of the
Mundas as their elder brethren.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15053src"
href="#xd21e15053" name="xd21e15053src">2</a> Mr. H&#299;ra Lal
suggests that the name Kharia is derived from <i>kharkhari</i>, a
palanquin or litter, and that the original name Kharkharia has been
contracted into Kharia. He states that in the Uriya country Oraons, who
carry litters, are also called Kharias. This derivation is in
accordance with the tradition of the Kharias that their first ancestor
carried a banghy, and with the fact that the Kols are the best
professional <i>dhoolie</i>-bearers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">In Raigarh the Kharias have only two subtribes, the
D&#363;dh, or milk Kharias, and the Delki. Of these the Delki are said
to be of mixed origin. They take food from Br&#257;hmans, and explain
that they do so because an ancestress went wrong with a Br&#257;hman.
It seems likely that they may be descended from the offspring of
immigrant Hindus in Chota N&#257;gpur with Kharia women, like similar
subdivisions in other tribes. The Delkis look down on the D&#363;dh
Kharias, saying that the latter eat the flesh of tigers and monkeys,
from which the Delkis abstain. In Bengal the tribe have two other
divisions, the Erenga and Munda Kharias.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Exogamy and totemism.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tribe is divided, like others, into totemistic
exogamous septs, which pay reverence to their totems. Thus members of
the Kulu (tortoise), Kiro (tiger), N&#257;g (cobra), Kankul (leopard)
and Kuto (crocodile) septs abstain from killing their totem animal,
fold their hands in obeisance when they meet it, and taking up some
dust from the animal&rsquo;s track place it on their heads as a mark of
veneration. Certain septs cannot wholly abstain from the consumption of
their sept totem, so they make a compromise. Thus members of the Baa,
or rice sept, cannot help eating rice, but they will not eat the scum
which gathers over the rice as it is being boiled. Those of the Bilum
or salt sept must not take up a little salt on one finger and suck it,
but must always use two or more fingers for conveying salt to the
mouth, presumably as a mark of respect. Members of the Suren or stone
sept will not make ovens with stones but only with clods of earth. The
tribe do not now think they are actually descended from their totems,
but tell stories accounting for the connection. Thus the Katang Kondai
or bamboo sept say that a girl in the family of their ancestors went to
cut bamboos and never came back. Her parents went to search for her and
heard a voice calling out from the bamboos, but could not find their
daughter. Then they understood that the bamboo was of their own family
and must not be cut by them. The supposition is apparently that the
girl was transformed into a bamboo.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage between members of the same sept is
forbidden, but the rule is not always observed. A brother&rsquo;s
daughter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448" name=
"pb448">448</a>]</span>may marry a sister&rsquo;s son, but not vice
versa. Marriage is always adult, and overtures come from the
boy&rsquo;s father. The customary bride-price is twelve bullocks, but
many families cannot afford this, and resort is then made to a fiction.
The boy&rsquo;s party make twelve models of bullocks in earth, and
placing each in a leaf-plate send them to the girl&rsquo;s party, who
throw away two, saying that one has been eaten by a tiger, and the
other has fallen into a pit and died. The remaining ten are returned to
the bridegroom&rsquo;s party, who throw away two, saying that they have
been sold to provide liquor for the Panch. For two of the eight now
left real animals are substituted, and for the other six one rupee
each, and the two cattle and six rupees are sent back to the
bride&rsquo;s party as the real bride-price. Poor families, however,
give four rupees instead of the two cattle, and ten rupees is among
them considered as the proper price, though even this is reduced on
occasion. The marriage party goes from the bride&rsquo;s to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house, and consists of women only. The men do not
go, as they say that on one occasion all the men of a Kharia wedding
procession were turned into stones, and they fear to undergo a similar
fate. The real reason may probably be that the journey of the bride is
a symbolic reminiscence of the time when she was carried off by force,
and hence it would be derogatory for the men to accompany her. The
bridegroom comes out to meet the bride riding on the shoulders of his
brother-in-law or paternal aunt&rsquo;s husband, who is known as
Dherha. He touches the bride, and both of them perform a dance. At the
wedding the bridegroom stands on a plough-yoke, and the bride on a
grinding-slab, and the Dherha walks seven times round them sprinkling
water on them from a mango-leaf. The couple are shut up alone for the
night, and next morning the girl goes to the river to wash her
husband&rsquo;s clothes. On her return a fowl is killed, and the couple
drink two drops of its blood in water mixed with turmeric, as a symbol
of the mixing of their own blood. A goat is killed, and they step in
its blood and enter their houses. The caste-people say to them,
&ldquo;Whenever a Kharia comes to your house, give him a cup of water
and tobacco and food if you have it,&rdquo; and the wedding is over.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After a girl is married her own mother will not eat
food cooked by her, as no two Kharias will take food together unless
they are of the same sept. When a married daughter goes back to the
house of her parents she cooks her food separately, and does not enter
their cook-room; if she did all the earthen pots would be defiled and
would have to be thrown away. A similar taboo marks the relations of a
woman towards her husband&rsquo;s elder brother, who is known as Kura
Sasur. She must not enter his house nor sit on a cot or stool before
him, nor touch him, nor cook food for him. If she touches him a fine of
a fowl with liquor is imposed by the caste, and for his touching her a
goat and liquor. This idea may perhaps have been established as a check
on the custom of fraternal polyandry, when the idea of the eldest
brother taking the father&rsquo;s place as head of the joint family
became prevalent.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Widow-marriage is permitted at the price of a feast to
the caste, and the payment of a small sum to the woman&rsquo;s family.
A widow must leave her children with her first husband&rsquo;s family
if required to do so. If she takes them with her they become entitled
to inherit her second husband&rsquo;s property, but receive only a
half-share as against a full share taken by his children. Divorce is
permitted by mutual agreement or for adultery of the woman. But the
practice is not looked upon with favour, and a divorced man or woman
rarely succeeds in obtaining another mate.</p>

<h3 class="main">8. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The principal deity of the Kharias is a hero called
Banda. They say that an Oraon had vowed to give his daughter to the man
who would clear the <i>k&#257;ns</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15103src" href="#xd21e15103" name="xd21e15103src">3</a> grass off
a hillock. Several men tried, and at last Banda did it by cutting out
the roots. He then demanded the girl&rsquo;s hand, but the Oraon
refused, thinking that Banda had cleared the grass by magic. Then Banda
went away and the girl died, and on learning of this Banda went and dug
her out of her grave, when she came to life and they were married.
Since then Banda has been worshipped. The tribe also venerate their
ploughs and axes, and on the day of Dasahra they make offerings to the
sun. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">9. Funeral rites.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tribe bury the dead, placing the head to the
north. When the corpse is taken out of the house two grains of rice are
thrown to each point of the compass to invite the ancestors of the
family to the funeral. And on the way, where two roads meet, the corpse
is set down and a little rice and cotton-seed sprinkled on the ground
as a guiding-mark to the ancestors. Before burial the corpse is
anointed with turmeric and oil, and carried seven times round the
grave, probably as a symbol of marriage to it. Each relative puts a
piece of cloth in the grave, and the dead man&rsquo;s cooking and
drinking-pots, his axe, stick, pipe and other belongings, and a
basketful of rice are buried with him. The mourners set three plants of
<i>orai</i> or <i>khas-khas</i> grass on the grave over the dead
man&rsquo;s head, middle and feet, and then they go to a tank and
bathe, chewing the roots of this grass. It would appear that the
<i>orai</i> grass may be an agent of purification or means of severance
from the dead man&rsquo;s ghost, like the leaves of the sacred
<i>n&#299;m</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e15126src" href="#xd21e15126"

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">10. Bringing back the souls of the dead.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the third day they bathe and are shaved, and catch
a fish, which is divided among all the relatives, however small it may
be, and eaten raw with salt, turmeric and garlic. It seems likely that
this fish may be considered to represent the dead man&rsquo;s spirit,
and is eaten in order to avoid being haunted by his ghost or for some
other object, and the fish may be eaten as a substitute for the dead
man&rsquo;s body, itself consumed in former times. On the tenth night
after the death the soul is called back, a lighted wick being set in a
vessel at the cross-roads where the rice and cotton had been sprinkled.
They call on the dead man, and when the flame of the lamp wavers in the
wind they break the vessel holding the lamp, saying that his soul has
come and joined them, and go home. On the following Dasahra festival,
when ancestors are worshipped, the spirit of the deceased is mingled
with the ancestors. A cock and hen are fed and let loose, and the
headman of the sept calls on the soul to come and join the ancestors
and give his protection to the family. When a man is killed by a tiger
the remains are collected and burnt on the spot. A goat is sacrificed
and eaten by the caste, and thereafter, when a wedding takes place in
that man&rsquo;s family, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href=
"#pb451" name="pb451">451</a>]</span>a goat is offered to his spirit.
The Kharias believe that the spirits of the dead are reborn in
children, and on the B&#257;rhi day, a month after the child&rsquo;s
birth, they ascertain which ancestor has been reborn by the usual
method of divination with grains of rice in water.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The strict taboos practised by the tribe as regards
food have already been mentioned. Men will take food from one another,
but not women. Men will also accept food cooked without water from
Br&#257;hmans, R&#257;jp&#363;ts and Bhuiyas. The Kharias will eat
almost any kind of flesh, including crocodile, rat, pig, tiger and
bear; they have now generally abandoned beef in deference to Hindu
prejudice, and also monkeys, though they formerly ate these animals,
the Topno sept especially being noted on this account.</p>

<h3 class="main">12. Caste rules and organisation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Temporary expulsion from caste is imposed for the
usual offences, and also for getting shaved or having clothes washed by
a barber or washerman other than a member of the caste. This rule seems
to arise either from an ultra-strict desire for social purity or from a
hostile reaction against the Hindus for the low estimation in which the
Kharias are held. Again it is a caste offence to carry the palanquin of
a K&#257;yasth, a Muhammadan, a Koshta (weaver) or a Nai (barber), or
to carry the <i>t&#257;zias</i> or representations of the tomb of
Husain in the Muharram procession. The caste have a headman who has the
title of Pardh&#257;n, with an assistant called Negi and a messenger
who is known as G&#257;nda. The headman must always be of the Samer
sept, the Negi of the Suren sept, and the G&#257;nda of the Bartha or
messenger sept. The headman&rsquo;s duty is to give water for the first
time to caste offenders on readmission, the Negi must make all
arrangements for the caste feast, and the G&#257;nda goes and summons
the tribesmen. In addition to the penalty feast a cash fine is imposed
on an erring member; of this rather more than half is given to the
assembled tribesmen for the purpose of buying <i>murra</i> or fried
grain on their way home on the following morning. The remaining sum is
divided between the three officers, the Pardh&#257;n and Negi getting
two shares each and the G&#257;nda one share. But the division is only
approximate, as the Kharias are unable to do the necessary calculation
for an odd number of rupees. The men have their hair tied in a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452" name=
"pb452">452</a>]</span>knot on the right side of the head, and women on
the left. The women are tattooed, but not the men.</p>
<p>Colonel Dalton writes of the tribal dances:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15158src" href="#xd21e15158" name="xd21e15158src">5</a>
&ldquo;The nuptial dances of the Kharias are very wild, and the
gestures of the dancers and the songs all bear more directly than
delicately on what is evidently considered the main object of the
festivities, the public recognition of the consummation of the
marriage. The bride and bridegroom are carried through the dances
seated on the hips of two of their companions. Dancing is an amusement
to which the Kharias, like all Kolarians, are passionately devoted. The
only noticeable difference in their style is that in the energy,
vivacity and warmth of their movements they excel all their
brethren.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="xd21e15162" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">13. Occupation and character.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kharias say that their original occupation is to
carry <i>dhoolies</i> or litters, and this, as well as the social rules
prohibiting them from carrying those of certain castes, is in favour of
the derivation of the name from <i>kharkhari</i>, a litter. They are
also cultivators, and collect forest produce. They are a wild and
backward tribe, as shown in the following extracts from an account by
Mr. Ball:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15173src" href="#xd21e15173" name=
"xd21e15173src">6</a> &ldquo;The first Kharias I met with were encamped
in the jungle at the foot of some hills. The hut was rudely made of a
few <i>s&#257;l</i> branches, its occupants being one man, an old and
two young women, besides three or four children. At the time of my
visit they were taking their morning meal; and as they regarded my
presence with the utmost indifference, without even turning round or
ceasing from their occupations, I remained for some time watching them.
They had evidently recently captured some small animal, but what it
was, as they had already eaten the skin, I could not ascertain. As I
looked on, the old woman distributed to the others, on plates of
<i>s&#257;l</i> leaves, what appeared to be the entrails of the animal,
and wrapping up her own portion between a couple of leaves threw it on
the fire in order to give it a very primitive cooking. With regard to
their ordinary food the Kharias chiefly depend on the jungle for a
supply of fruits, leaves and roots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kharias never make iron themselves, but are altogether
dependent on the neighbouring baz&#257;rs for their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name=
"pb453">453</a>]</span>supplies. Had they at any period possessed a
knowledge of the art of making iron, conservative of their customs as
such races are, it is scarcely likely that they would have forgotten
it. It is therefore not unreasonable to suppose that there was a period
prior to the advent of the Hindus when iron was quite unknown to
them&mdash;when, owing to the absence of cultivation in the plains,
they were even more dependent on the supply of jungle food than they
are at present. In those times their axes and their implements for
grubbing up roots were in all probability made of stone, and their
arrows had tips of the same material.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In their persons the Kharias are very dirty, seldom if ever
washing themselves. Their features are decidedly of a low character,
not unlike the Bhumij, but there seemed to me to be an absence of any
strongly-marked type in their faces or build, such as enables one to
know a Sant&#257;l and even a Kurmi at a glance.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Khat&#299;k</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Khat&#299;k.</b>&mdash;A functional caste of Hindu
mutton-butchers and vegetable sellers. They numbered nearly 13,000
persons in the Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r in 1911, and are, as
might be expected, principally returned from the Districts with a
considerable urban population, Amraoti, Jubbulpore, N&#257;gpur and
Saugor. The name is derived from the Sanskrit Khattika,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e15218src" href="#xd21e15218" name=
"xd21e15218src">1</a> a butcher or hunter. In northern <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb454" href="#pb454" name=
"pb454">454</a>]</span>India Mr. Crooke states that the caste are
engaged in keeping and selling pigs and retailing vegetables and
fruits, and does not specially mention that they slaughter animals,
though in Agra one of their subcastes is named B&#363;char, a
corruption of the English word butcher. In the Punjab Sir D.
Ibbetson<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15226src" href="#xd21e15226" name=
"xd21e15226src">2</a> says of them that, &ldquo;They form a connecting
link between the scavengers and the leather-workers, though they occupy
a social position distinctly inferior to that of the latter. They are
great keepers of pigs and poultry, which a Cham&#257;r would not
keep.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15231src" href="#xd21e15231" name=
"xd21e15231src">3</a> At the same time many of them tan and dye leather
and indeed are not seldom confused with the Chamr&#257;ng. The
Khat&#299;k is said sometimes to keep sheep and goats and twist their
hair into waist-bands for sale.&rdquo; Sir H. Risley again describes
the Khat&#299;ks of Bih&#257;r as a cultivating and vegetable-selling
caste.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15234src" href="#xd21e15234" name=
"xd21e15234src">4</a> The differences in the principal occupations
ascribed to the caste are thus somewhat remarkable. In the Central
Provinces the Khat&#299;ks are primarily slaughterers of sheep and
goats and mutton-butchers, though they also keep pigs, and some of
them, who object to this trade, make their livelihood by selling
vegetables. Both in the United Provinces and Punjab the Khat&#299;ks
are considered to be connected with the P&#257;sis and probably an
offshoot of that caste. In the Central Provinces they are said to be an
inferior branch of the Gadaria or shepherd caste. The Gadarias state
that their old sheep were formerly allowed to die. Then they appointed
some poor men of the community to kill them and sell the flesh,
dividing the profits with the owner, and thus the Khat&#299;k caste
arose. The Khat&#299;ks accept cooked food from the Gadarias, but the
latter do not reciprocate.</p>
<p>The Khat&#299;ks are both Hindu and Muhammadan by religion, the
latter being also known as Gai-Khat&#299;k or cow-killer; but these may
more suitably be classed with the Kasais or Muhammadan butchers. In the
Mar&#257;tha Districts the Hindu Khat&#299;ks are divided into two
subcastes, the Ber&#257;ria or those from Ber&#257;r, and the
Jh&#257;di or those of the forest country of the Wainganga valley.
These will take <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href="#pb455"
name="pb455">455</a>]</span>food together, but do not intermarry. They
have the usual set of exogamous clans or septs, many of which are of a
totemistic nature, being named after plants, animals or natural
objects. In Jubbulpore, owing to their habit of keeping pigs and the
dirty state of their dwellings, one of their divisions is named Lendha,
which signifies the excrement of swine. Here the sept is called
<i>b&#257;n</i>, while in Wardha it is known as <i>kul</i> or
<i>&#257;dn&#257;m</i>. Marriage within the sept is forbidden. When
arranging a match they consider it essential that the boy should be
taller than the girl, but do not insist on his being older. A
bride-price is sometimes paid, especially if the parents of the girl
are poor, but the practice is considered derogatory. In such a case the
father is thought to sell his daughter and he is called B&#257;d or
Bh&#257;nd. Marriages commonly take place on the fifth, seventh or
ninth day after the Holi festival, or on the festival of
Bads&#257;vitri, the third day of Bais&#257;kh (light fortnight). When
the bridegroom leaves the house to set out for the wedding his mother
or aunt waves a pestle and churning-stick round him, puts a piece of
betel-vine in his mouth and gives him her breast to suck. He then steps
on a little earthen lamp-saucer placed over an egg and breaks them, and
leaves the house without looking back. These rites are common to many
castes, but their exact significance is obscure. The pestle and
churning-stick and egg may perhaps be emblems of fertility. At the
wedding the fathers of the couple split some wood into shreds, and,
placing it in a little pit with cotton, set a light to it. If it is all
burnt up the ceremony has been properly performed, but if any is left,
the people laugh and say that the corpses of the family&rsquo;s
ancestors were not wholly consumed on the pyre. To effect a divorce the
husband and wife break a stick in the presence of the caste
<i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee, and if a divorced woman or one who
has deserted her husband marries again, the first husband has to give a
feast to the caste on the tenth day after the wedding; this is perhaps
in the nature of a funeral feast to signify that she is dead to him.
The remarriage of widows is permitted. A girl who is seduced by a
member of the caste, even though she may be delivered of a child, may
be married <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb456" href="#pb456" name=
"pb456">456</a>]</span>to him by the maimed rites used for widows. But
she cannot take part in auspicious ceremonies, and her feet are not
washed by married women like those of a proper bride. Even if a girl be
seduced by an outsider, except a Hindu of the impure castes or a
Muhammadan, she may be taken back into the community and her child will
be recognised as a member of it. But they say that if a Khat&#299;k
keeps a woman of another caste he will be excommunicated until he has
put her away, and his children will be known as Akre or bastard
Khat&#299;ks, these being numerous in Ber&#257;r. The caste burn or
bury the dead as their means permit, and on the third day they place on
the pyre some sugar, cakes, liquor, sweets and fruit for the use of the
dead man&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p>The occupation of the Khat&#299;k is of course horrible to Hindu
ideas, and the social position of the caste is very low. In some
localities they are considered impure, and high-caste Hindus who do not
eat meat will wash themselves if forced to touch a Khat&#299;k.
Elsewhere they rank just above the impure castes, but do not enter
Hindu temples. These Khat&#299;ks slaughter sheep and goats and sell
the flesh, but they do not cure the skins, which are generally exported
to Madras. The Hindu Khat&#299;ks often refuse to slaughter animals
themselves and employ a Muhammadan to do so by the rite of
<i>hal&#257;l</i>. The blood is sometimes sold to Gonds, who cook and
eat it mixed with grain. Other members of the caste are engaged in
cultivation, or retail vegetables and grain.</p>

"pb457">457</a>]</span>bears out the claim to be derived either from
the Aryans or some later immigrants from Central Asia: &ldquo;They are
a handsome fair-skinned class, some of them with blue or grey eyes, in
make and appearance like V&#257;nias (Banias), only larger and more
vigorous.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15275src" href=
"#xd21e15275" name="xd21e15275src">1</a> Mr. Crooke states that,
&ldquo;their women have a reputation for their beauty and fair
complexion. The proverb runs, &lsquo;A Khatri woman would be fair
without fine clothes or ornaments,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;Only an albino is
fairer than a Khatri woman.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15280src" href="#xd21e15280" name="xd21e15280src">2</a> Their
legend of origin is as follows: &ldquo;When Parasur&#257;ma the
Br&#257;hman was slaying the Kshatriyas in revenge for the theft of the
sacred cow K&#257;mdhenu and for the murder of his father, a pregnant
Kshatriya woman took refuge in the hut of a S&#257;raswat Br&#257;hman.
When Parasur&#257;ma came up he asked the Br&#257;hman who the woman
was, and he said she was his daughter. Parasur&#257;ma then told him to
eat with her in order to prove it, and the Br&#257;hman ate out of the
same leaf-plate as the woman. The child to whom she subsequently gave
birth was the ancestor of the Khatris, and in memory of this
S&#257;raswat Br&#257;hmans will eat with Khatris to the present
day.&rdquo; The S&#257;raswat Br&#257;hman priests of the Khatris do as
a matter of fact take <i>katcha</i> food or that cooked with water from
them, and smoke from their huqqas, and this is another strong argument
in favour of their origin either from Br&#257;hmans or
R&#257;jp&#363;ts.</p>
<p>The classical account of the Khatris is that given in Sir George
Campbell&rsquo;s <i>Ethnology of India</i>, and it may be reproduced
here as in other descriptions of the caste:</p>

Khatris.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Trade is their main occupation; but in fact
they have broader and more distinguishing features. Besides
monopolising the trade of the Punjab and the greater part of
Afgh&#257;nist&#257;n, and doing a good deal beyond those limits, they
are in the Punjab the chief civil administrators, and have almost all
literate work in their hands. So far as the Sikhs have a priesthood,
they are, moreover, the priests or <i>gurus</i> of the Sikhs. Both
N&#257;nak and Govind were, and the Sodis and Bedis of the present day
are, Khatris. Thus then they are in fact in the Punjab, so far as a
more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name=
"pb458">458</a>]</span>energetic race will permit them, all that
Mahratta Br&#257;hmins are in the Mahratta country, besides engrossing
the trade which the Mahratta Br&#257;hmins have not. They are not
usually military in their character, but are quite capable of using the
sword when necessary. Diw&#257;n S&#257;wan Mal, Governor of Multan,
and his notorious successor M&#363;lraj, and very many of Ranj&#299;t
Singh&rsquo;s chief functionaries were Khatris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even under Mahomedan rulers in the west they have risen to
high administrative posts. There is a record of a Khatri Diw&#257;n of
Badaksh&#257;n or Kurd&#257;z; and, I believe, of a Khatri Governor of
Pesh&#257;war under the Afghans. The Emperor Akbar&rsquo;s famous
minister, Todarmal, was a Khatri; and a relative of that man of
undoubted energy, the great commissariat contractor of Agra, Joti
Persh&#257;d, lately informed me that he also is a Khatri. Altogether,
there can be no doubt that these Khatris are one of the most acute,
energetic and remarkable races in India, though in fact, except locally
in the Punjab, they are not much known to Europeans. The Khatris are
staunch Hindus, and it is somewhat singular that, while giving a
religion and priests to the Sikhs, they themselves are comparatively
seldom Sikhs. The Khatris are a very fine, fair, handsome race, and, as
may be gathered from what I have already said, they are very generally
educated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a large subordinate class of Khatris, somewhat
lower, but of equal mercantile energy, called Rors or Roras. The proper
Khatris of higher grade will often deny all connection with them, or at
least only admit that they have some sort of bastard kindred with
Khatris, but I think there can be no doubt that they are ethnologically
the same, and they are certainly mixed up with Khatris in their
avocations. I shall treat the whole kindred as generically Khatris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of the Khatris then thus broadly, they have, as I
have said, the whole trade of the Punjab and of most of
Afgh&#257;nist&#257;n. No village can get on without the Khatri who
keeps the accounts, does the banking business, and buys and sells the
grain. They seem, too, to get on with the people better than most
traders and usurers of this kind. In Afgh&#257;nist&#257;n, among a
rough and alien people, the Khatris <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb459" href="#pb459" name="pb459">459</a>]</span>are as a rule
confined to the position of humble dealers, shopkeepers and
moneylenders; but in that capacity the Path&#257;ns seem to look on
them as a kind of valuable animal, and a Path&#257;n will steal another
man&rsquo;s Khatri, not only for the sake of ransom, as is frequently
done on the frontier of Pesh&#257;war and Haz&#257;ra, but also as he
might steal a milch-cow, or as Jews might, I dare say, be carried off
in the Middle Ages with a view to render them profitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know the exact limits of Khatri occupation to the
West, but certainly in all Eastern Afgh&#257;nist&#257;n they seem to
be just as much a part of the established community as they are in the
Punjab. They find their way far into Central Asia, but the further they
get the more depressed and humiliating is their position. In Turkistan,
Vamb&eacute;ry speaks of them with great contempt, as yellow-faced
Hindus of a cowardly and sneaking character. Under Turcoman rule they
could hardly be otherwise. They are the only Hindus known in Central
Asia. In the Punjab they are so numerous that they cannot all be rich
and mercantile; and many of them hold land, cultivate, take service,
and follow various avocations.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Higher and lower groups.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Khatris have a very complicated system of
subdivisions, which it is not necessary to detail here in view of their
small strength in the Province. As a rule they marry only one wife,
though a second may be taken for the purpose of getting offspring. But
parents are very reluctant to give their daughters to a man who is
already married. The remarriage of widows is forbidden and divorce also
is not recognised, but an unfaithful wife may be turned out of the
house and expelled from the caste. Though they practise monogamy,
however, the Khatris place no restrictions on the keeping of
concubines, and from the offspring of such women inferior branches of
the caste have grown up. In Gujar&#257;t these are known as the Dasa
and Pancha groups, and they may not eat or intermarry with proper
Khatris.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15318src" href="#xd21e15318" name=
"xd21e15318src">3</a> The name Khatri seems there to be restricted to
these inferior groups, while the caste proper is called Brahma-Kshatri.
There is also a marked distinction in their occupation, for, while the
Brahma-Kshatris are hereditary District <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb460" href="#pb460" name="pb460">460</a>]</span>officials, pleaders,
bankers and Government servants, the Khatris are engaged in weaving,
and formerly prepared the fine cotton cloth of Surat and Broach, while
they also make gold and silver thread, and the lace used for
embroidery.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15325src" href="#xd21e15325"
name="xd21e15325src">4</a> As a class they are said to be thriftless
and idle, and at least the Khatris of Surat to be excessively fond of
strong drink. The Khatris of Nim&#257;r in the Central Provinces are
also weavers, and it seems not unlikely that they may be a branch of
these Gujar&#257;t Khatris of the inferior class, and that the
well-known gold and silver lace and embroidery industry of
Burh&#257;npur may have been introduced by them from Surat. The Khatris
of Narsinghpur are dyers, and may not improbably be connected with the
Nim&#257;r weavers. The other Khatris scattered here and there over the
Provinces may belong to the higher branch of the caste.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Marriage and funeral customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In conclusion some extracts may be given from the
interesting account of the marriage and funeral customs of the
Brahma-Kshatris in Gujar&#257;t:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15335src"
href="#xd21e15335" name="xd21e15335src">5</a> &ldquo;On the wedding-day
shortly before the marriage hour the bridegroom, his face covered with
flower-garlands and wearing a long tunic and a yellow silk waistcloth,
escorted by the women of his family, goes to the bride&rsquo;s house on
horseback in procession.... Before the bridegroom&rsquo;s party arrive
the bride, dressed in a head-cloth, bodice, a red robe, and loose
yellow Muhammadan trousers, is seated in a closed palanquin or
<i>balai</i> set in front of the house. The bridegroom on dismounting
walks seven times round the palanquin, the bride&rsquo;s brother at
each turn giving him a cut with an oleander twig, and the women of the
family throwing showers of cake from the windows. He retires, and while
mounting his horse, and before he is in the saddle, the bride&rsquo;s
father comes out, and, giving him a present, leads him into the
marriage-hall.... The girl keeps her eyes closed throughout the whole
day, not opening them until the bridegroom is ushered into the
marriage-booth, so that the first object she sees is her intended
husband. On the first Monday, Thursday or Friday after the marriage the
bride is hid either in her own or in a neighbour&rsquo;s house. The
bridegroom comes in state, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb461" href=
"#pb461" name="pb461">461</a>]</span>and with the point of his sword
touches the outer doors of seven houses, and then begins to search for
his wife. The time is one of much fun and merriment, the women of the
house bantering and taunting the bridegroom, especially when he is long
in finding his wife&rsquo;s hiding-place. When she is found the
bridegroom leads the bride to the marriage-hall, and they sit there
combing each other&rsquo;s hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with their funeral ceremonies Mr. Bh&#299;mbhai
Kirp&#257;r&#257;m gives the following particulars of the custom of
beating the breasts:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15347src" href=
"#xd21e15347" name="xd21e15347src">6</a> &ldquo;Contrary to the
Gujar&#257;t practice of beating only the breast, the Brahma-Kshatri
women beat the forehead, breast and knees. For thirteen days after a
death women weep and beat their breasts thrice a day, at morning, noon
and evening. Afterwards they weep and beat their breasts every evening
till a year has passed, not even excepting Sundays, Tuesdays or Hindu
holidays. During this year of mourning the female relations of the
deceased used to eat nothing but millet-bread and pulse; but this
custom is gradually being given up.&rdquo;</p>

"xd21e15358src" href="#xd21e15358" name="xd21e15358src">1</a>&mdash;A
small Muhammadan sect of traders belonging to Gujar&#257;t, who retain
some Hindu practices. They reside in Wardha, N&#257;gpur and the
Ber&#257;r Districts, and numbered about 500 persons in 1911 as against
300 in 1901. The Khoj&#257;hs are Muhammadans of the Shia sect, and
their ancestors were converted Hindus of the Loh&#257;na trading caste
of Sind, who are probably akin to the Khatris. As shown in the article
on Cutchi, the Cutchi or Meman traders are also converted Loh&#257;nas.
The name Khoj&#257;h is a corruption of the Turkish Khw&#257;jah, Lord,
and this is supposed to be a Muhammadan equivalent for the title
Th&#257;kur or Thakkar applied to the Loh&#257;nas. The Khoj&#257;hs
belong to the Naz&#257;rian branch of the Egyptian Ismailia sect, and
the founder of this sect in Persia was Hasan Sab&#257;h, who lived at
the beginning of the eleventh century and founded the order of the
Fidawis or devotees, who were the Assassins of the Crusades. Hasan
subsequently threw off <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb462" href=
"#pb462" name="pb462">462</a>]</span>his allegiance to the Egyptian
Caliph and made himself the head of his own sect with the title of
Shaikh-ul-Jabal or Lord. He was known to the Crusaders as the
&lsquo;Old Man of the Mountain.&rsquo; His third successor Hasan
(<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1163) declared himself to be the
unrevealed Im&#257;m and preached that no action of a believer in him
could be a sin. It is through this Hasan that His Highness the Aga
Kh&#257;n traces his descent from Ali. Subsequently emissaries of the
sect came to India, and one P&#299;r Sadr-ud-d&#299;n converted the
Loh&#257;nas. According to one account this man was a Hindu slave of
Im&#257;m Hasan. Sadr-ud-d&#299;n preached that his master Hasan was
the Nishkalanki or tenth incarnation of Vishnu. The Adam of the Semitic
story of the creation was identified with the Hindu deity Vishnu, the
Prophet Muhammad with Siva, and the first five Im&#257;ms of Ismailia
with the five P&#257;ndava brothers. By this means the new faith was
made more acceptable to the Loh&#257;nas. In 1845 Aga Sh&#257;h Hasan
Ali, the Ismailia unrevealed Im&#257;m, came and settled in India, and
his successor is His Highness the Aga Kh&#257;n.</p>
<p>The Khoj&#257;hs retain some Hindu customs. Boys have their ears
bored and a lock of hair is left on a child&rsquo;s head to be shaved
and offered at some shrine. Circumcision and the wearing of a beard are
optional. They do not have mosques, but meet to pray at a lodge called
the Jama&rsquo;at Kh&#257;na. They repeat the names of their P&#299;rs
or saints on a rosary made of 101 beads of clay from Karbala, the scene
of the death of Hasan and Husain. At their marriages, deaths and on
every new-moon day, contributions are levied which are sent to His
Highness the Aga Kh&#257;n. &ldquo;A remarkable feature at a
Khoj&#257;h&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; Mr. Far&#299;di states, &ldquo;is the
<i>samarchhanta</i> or Holy Drop. The Jama&rsquo;at officer asks the
dying Khoj&#257;h whether he wishes for the Holy Drop, and if the
latter agrees he must bequeath Rs. 5 to Rs. 500 to the Jama&rsquo;at.
The officer dilutes a cake of Karbala clay in water and moistens the
lips of the dying man with it, sprinkling the remainder over his face,
neck and chest. The touch of the Holy Drop is believed to save the
departing soul from the temptation of the Arch-Fiend, and to remove the
death-agony as completely as among the Sunnis does <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb463" href="#pb463" name="pb463">463</a>]</span>the
recital at a death-bed of the chapter of the Kor&#257;n known as the
S&#363;rah-i-Y&#257;-s&#299;n. If the dead man is old and grey-haired
the hair after death is dyed with henna. A garland of cakes of Karbala
clay is tied round the neck of the corpse. If the body is to be buried
locally two small circular patches of silk cloth cut from the covering
of Husain&rsquo;s tomb, called <i>chashmah</i> or spectacles, are laid
over the eyes. Those Khoj&#257;hs who can afford it have their bodies
placed in air-tight coffins and transported to the field of Karbala in
Persia to be buried there. The bodies are taken by steamer to
B&#257;ghd&#257;d, and thence by camel to Karbala.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Khoj&#257;hs are keen and enterprising traders, and are
great travellers by land and sea, visiting and settling in distant
countries for purposes of trade. They have business connections with
Ceylon, Burma, Singapore, China and Japan, and with ports of the
Persian Gulf, Arabia and East Africa. Khoj&#257;h boys go as
apprentices in foreign Khoj&#257;h firms on salaries of Rs. 200 to Rs.
2000 a year with board and lodging.&rdquo; <span class=

derived from <i>ko</i> or <i>k&#363;</i>, a Telugu word for a
mountain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15501src" href="#xd21e15501" name=
"xd21e15501src">2</a> Their own traditions as to their origin are of
little historical value, but they were almost certainly at one time the
rulers of the country in which they now reside. It was the custom until
recently for the R&#257;ja of K&#257;l&#257;handi to sit on the lap of
a Khond on his accession while he received the oaths of fealty. The man
who held the R&#257;ja was the eldest member of a particular family,
residing in the village of Gugsai Patna, and had the title of Patnaji.
The coronation of a new R&#257;ja took place in this village, to which
all the chiefs repaired. The Patnaji would be seated on a large rock,
richly dressed, with a cloth over his knees on which the R&#257;ja sat.
The D&#299;w&#257;n or minister then tied the turban of state on the
R&#257;ja&rsquo;s head, while all the other chiefs present held the
ends of the cloth. The ceremony fell into abeyance when Raghu Kesari
Deo was made R&#257;ja on the deposition of his predecessor for
misconduct, as the Patnaji refused to install a second R&#257;ja, while
one previously consecrated by him was still living. The R&#257;ja was
also accustomed to marry a Khond girl as one of his wives, though
latterly he did not allow her to live in the palace. These customs have
lately been abandoned; they may probably be interpreted as a
recognition that the R&#257;jas of K&#257;l&#257;handi derived their
rights from the Khonds. Many of the zam&#299;nd&#257;ri estates of
K&#257;l&#257;handi and Sonpur are still held by members of the
tribe.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Tribal divisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is no strict endogamy within the Khond tribe. It
has two main divisions: the Kutia Khonds who are hillmen and retain
their primitive tribal customs, and the plain-dwelling Khonds who have
acquired a tincture of Hinduism. The Kutia or hill Khonds are said to
be so called because they break the skulls of animals when they kill
them for food; the word <i>kutia</i> meaning one who breaks or smashes.
The plain-dwelling Khonds have a number of subdivisions which are
supposed to be endogamous, though the rule is not strictly observed.
Among these the R&#257;j Khonds are the highest, and are usually landed
proprietors. A man, however, is not considered to be a R&#257;j Khond
unless he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb466" href="#pb466" name=
"pb466">466</a>]</span>possesses some land, and if a R&#257;j Khond
takes a bride from another group he descends to it. A similar rule
applies among some of the other groups, a man being relegated to his
wife&rsquo;s division when he marries into one which is lower than his
own. The Dal Khonds may probably have been soldiers, the word
<i>dal</i> meaning an army. They are also known as Adi Kandh or the
superior Khonds, and as B&#257;l&#363;sudia or &lsquo;Shaven.&rsquo; At
present they usually hold the honourable position of village priest,
and have to a certain extent adopted Hindu usages, refusing to eat
fowls or buffaloes, and offering the leaves of the <i>tulsi</i> (basil)
to their deities. The Kandhanas are so called because they grow
turmeric, which is considered rather a low thing to do, and the
P&#257;khia because they eat the flesh of the <i>por</i> or buffalo.
The Gauria are graziers, and the N&#257;gla or naked ones apparently
take their name from their paucity of clothing. The Ut&#257;r or
Satbhuiy&#257;n are a degraded group, probably of illegitimate descent;
for the other Khonds will take daughters from them, but will not give
their daughters to them.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">3. Exogamous septs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Traditionally the Khonds have thirty-two exogamous
septs, but the number has now increased. All the members of one sept
live in the same locality about some central village. Thus the
T&#363;pa sept are collected round the village of Teplagarh in the
Patna State, the Loa sept round Sindhekala, the Borga sept round
Bangomunda, and so on. The names of the septs are derived either from
the names of villages or from titles or nicknames. Each sept is further
divided into a number of subsepts whose names are of a totemistic
nature, being derived from animals, plants or natural objects.
Instances of these are Bachh&#257;s calf, Chhatra umbrella, Hikoka
horse, Kelka the kingfisher, Konjaka the monkey, Mandinga an earthen
pot, and so on. It is a very curious fact that while the names of the
septs appear to belong to the Khond language, those of the subsepts are
all Uriya words, and this affords some ground for the supposition that
they are more recent than the septs, an opinion to which Sir H. Risley
inclines. On the other hand, the fact that the subsepts have totemistic
names appears difficult of explanation under this hypothesis.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb467" href="#pb467" name=
"pb467">467</a>]</span>Members of the subsept regard the animal or
plant after which it is named as sacred. Those of the Kadam group will
not stand under the tree of that name. Those of the Narsingha<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e15531src" href="#xd21e15531" name=
"xd21e15531src">3</a> sept will not kill a tiger or eat the meat of any
animal wounded or killed by this animal. The same subsept will be found
in several different septs, and a man may not marry a woman belonging
either to the same sept or subsept as his own. But kinship through
females is disregarded, and he may take his maternal uncle&rsquo;s
daughter to wife, and in K&#257;l&#257;handi is not debarred from
wedding his mother&rsquo;s sister.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15534src"

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">4. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage is adult and a large price, varying from 12
to 20 head of cattle, was formerly demanded for the bride. This has
now, however, been reduced in some localities to two or three animals
and a rupee each in lieu of the others, or cattle may be entirely
dispensed with and some grain given. If a man cannot afford to purchase
a bride he may serve his father-in-law for seven years as the condition
of obtaining her. A proposal for marriage is made by placing a brass
cup and three arrows at the door of the girl&rsquo;s father. He will
remove these once to show his reluctance, and they will be again
replaced. If he removes them a second time, it signifies his definite
refusal of the match, but if he allows them to remain, the
bridegroom&rsquo;s friends go to him and say, &lsquo;We have noticed a
beautiful flower in passing through your village and desire to pluck
it.&rsquo; The wedding procession goes from the bride&rsquo;s to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house as among the Gonds; this custom, as remarked
by Mr. Bell, is not improbably a survival of marriage by capture, when
the husband carried off his wife and married her at his own house. At
the marriage the bride and bridegroom come out, each sitting on the
shoulders of one of their relatives. The bridegroom pulls the bride to
his side, when a piece of cloth is thrown over them, and they are tied
together with a string of new yarn wound round them seven times. A cock
is sacrificed, and the cheeks of the couple are singed with burnt
bread. They pass the night in a veranda, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb468" href="#pb468" name="pb468">468</a>]</span>next
day are taken to a tank, the bridegroom being armed with a bow and
arrows. He shoots one through each of seven cowdung cakes, the bride
after each shot washing his forehead and giving him a green twig for a
tooth-brush and some sweets. This is symbolical of their future course
of life, when the husband will procure food by hunting, while the wife
will wait on him and prepare his food. Sexual intercourse before
marriage between a man and girl of the tribe is condoned so long as
they are not within the prohibited degrees of relationship, and in
K&#257;l&#257;handi such <i>liaisons</i> are a matter of ordinary
occurrence. If a girl is seduced by one man and subsequently married to
another, the first lover usually pays the husband a sum of seven to
twelve rupees as compensation. In Sambalpur a girl may choose her own
husband, and the couple commonly form an intimacy while engaged in
agricultural work. Such unions are known as <i>Udhlia</i> or
&lsquo;Love in the fields.&rsquo; If the parents raise any objection to
the match the couple elope and return as man and wife, when they have
to give a feast to the caste, and if the girl was previously betrothed
to another man the husband must pay him compensation. In the last case
the union is called <i>Paisa moli</i> or marriage by purchase. A trace
of fraternal polyandry survives in the custom by which the younger
brothers are allowed access to the elder brother&rsquo;s wife till the
time of their own marriage. Widow-marriage and divorce are
recognised.</p>

<h3 class="main">5. Customs at birth.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For one day after a child has been born the mother is
allowed no food. On the sixth day she herself shaves the child&rsquo;s
head and bites his nails short with her teeth, after which she takes a
bow and arrows and stands with the child facing successively to the
four points of the compass. The idea of this is to make the child a
skilful hunter when he grows up. Children are named in their fifth or
sixth year. Names are sometimes given after some personal peculiarity,
as Lammudia, long-headed, or Khanja, one having six fingers; or after
some circumstance of the birth, as Ghosian, in compliment to the Ghasia
(grass-cutter) woman who acts as midwife; Jugi, because some holy
mendicant (Yogi) was halting in the village when the child was born; or
a child may be named after the day of the week or month on which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name=
"pb469">469</a>]</span>it was born. The tribe believe that the souls of
the departed are born again as children, and boys have on occasion been
named Majhi&#257;n Budhi or the old head-woman, whom they suppose to
have been born again with a change of sex. Major Macpherson observed
the same belief:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15560src" href=
"#xd21e15560" name="xd21e15560src">5</a> &ldquo;To determine the best
name for the child, the priest drops grains of rice into a cup of
water, naming with each grain a deceased ancestor. He pronounces, from
the movements of the seed in the fluid, and from observations made on
the person of the infant, which of his progenitors has reappeared in
him, and the child generally, but not uniformly, receives the name of
that ancestor.&rdquo; When the children are named, they are made to
ride a goat or a pig, as a mark of respect, it is said, to the ancestor
who has been reborn in them. Names usually recur after the third
generation.</p>

<h3 class="main">6. Disposal of the dead.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dead are buried as a rule, but the practice of
cremating the bodies of adults is increasing. When a body is buried a
rupee or a copper coin is tied in the sheet, so that the deceased may
not go penniless to the other world. Sometimes the dead man&rsquo;s
clothes and bows and arrows are buried with him. On the tenth day the
soul is brought back. Outside the village, where two roads meet, rice
is offered to a cock, and if it eats, this is a sign that the soul has
come. The soul is then asked to ride on a bowstick covered with cloth,
and is brought to the house and placed in a corner with those of other
relatives. The souls are fed annually with rice on the harvest and
Dasahra festivals. In Sambalpur a ball of powdered rice is placed under
a tree with a lamp near it, and the first insect that settles on the
ball is taken to be the soul, and is brought home and worshipped. The
souls of infants who die before the umbilical cord has dropped are not
brought back, because they are considered to have scarcely come into
existence; and Sir E. Gait records that one of the causes of female
infanticide was the belief that the souls of girl-children thus killed
would not be born again, and hence the number of future female births
would decrease. This belief partially conflicts with that of the change
of sex on rebirth mentioned above; but the two might very well exist
together. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href="#pb470" name=
"pb470">470</a>]</span>souls of women who die during pregnancy or after
a miscarriage, or during the monthly period of impurity are also not
brought back, no doubt because they are held to be malignant
spirits.</p>

<h3 class="main">7. Occupation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Khond traditionally despises all occupations
except those of husbandry, hunting and war. &ldquo;In Orissa,&rdquo;
Sir H. Risky states, &ldquo;they claim full rights of property in the
soil in virtue of having cleared the jungle and prepared the land for
cultivation. In some villages individual ownership is unknown, and the
land is cultivated on a system of temporary occupation subject to
periodical redistribution under the orders of the headman or
<i>m&#257;lik</i>.&rdquo; Like the other forest tribes they are
improvident and fond of drink.</p>
<p>Macpherson<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15582src" href="#xd21e15582"
name="xd21e15582src">6</a> described the Khonds as faithful to friends,
devoted to their chiefs, resolute, brave, hospitable and laborious; but
these high qualities meet with no recognition among the Uriya Hindus,
who regard their stupidity as the salient attribute of the Khonds and
have various tales in derision of them, like those told of the weavers.
They consider the Khonds as only a little superior to the impure Doms
(musicians and sweepers), and say, &lsquo;<i>Kandh ghare Domna
Mantri</i>,&rsquo; or &lsquo;In a Kandh house the Dom is Prime
Minister.&rsquo; This is paralleled by the similar relation between the
Gonds and Pardh&#257;ns. The arms of the Khonds were a light,
long-handled sword with a blade very curiously carved, the bow and
arrow and the sling&mdash;no shields being used. The axe also was used
with both hands, to strike and guard, its handle being partly defended
by brass plates and wire for the latter purpose. The following
description of a battle between rival Khond clans was recorded by Major
Macpherson as having been given to him by an eye-witness, and may be
reproduced for its intrinsic interest; the fight was between the
hostile tribes of Bora M&#363;ta and Bora Des in the Gumsur
territory:</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">8. A Khond combat.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;At about 12 o&rsquo;clock in the day the people
of Bora Des began to advance in a mass across the S&#257;lki river, the
boundary between the Districts, into the plain of Kurm&#299;ngia, where
a much smaller force was arrayed to oppose them. The combatants were
protected from the neck to the loins <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb471" href="#pb471" name="pb471">471</a>]</span>by skins, and cloth
was wound round their legs down to the heel, but the arms were quite
bare. Round the heads of many, too, cloth was wound, and for
distinction the people of Bora M&#363;ta wore peacock&rsquo;s feathers
in their hair, while those of Bora Des had cock&rsquo;s tail plumes.
They advanced with horns blowing, and the gongs beat when they passed a
village. The women followed behind carrying pots of water and food for
refreshments, and the old men who were past bearing arms were there,
giving advice and encouragement. As the adverse parties approached,
showers of stones, handed by the women, flew from slings from either
side, and when they came within range arrows came in flights and many
fell back wounded. At length single combats sprang up betwixt
individuals who advanced before the rest, and when the first man fell
all rushed to dip their axes in his blood, and hacked the body to
pieces. The first man who himself unwounded slew his opponent, struck
off the latter&rsquo;s right arm and rushed with it to the priest in
the rear, who bore it off as an offering to Loha Pennu (the Iron God or
the God of Arms) in his grove. The right arms of the rest who fell were
cut off in like manner and heaped in the rear beside the women, and to
them the wounded were carried for care, and the fatigued men constantly
retired for water. The conflict was at length general. All were engaged
hand-to-hand, and now fought fiercely, now paused by common consent for
a moment&rsquo;s breathing. In the end the men of Bora Des, although
superior in numbers, began to give way, and before four o&rsquo;clock
they were driven across the S&#257;lki, leaving sixty men dead on the
field, while the killed on the side of the Bora M&#363;ta did not
exceed thirty. And from the entire ignorance of the Khonds of the
simplest healing processes, at least an equal number of the wounded
died after the battle. The right hands of the slain were hung up by
both parties on the trees of the villages and the dead were carried off
to be burned. The people of Bora Des the next morning flung a piece of
bloody cloth on the field of battle, a challenge to renew the conflict
which was quickly accepted, and so the contest was kept up for three
days.&rdquo; The above account could, of course, find no place in a
description of the Khonds of this generation, but has been thought
worthy of quotation, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb472" href="#pb472"
name="pb472">472</a>]</span>as detailed descriptions of the manner of
fighting of these tribes, now weaned from war by the British

<h3 class="main">9. Social customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Khonds will admit into the community a male orphan
child of any superior caste, including the Binjhw&#257;rs and Gonds. A
virgin of any age of one of these castes will also be admitted. A Gond
man who takes a Khond girl to wife can become a Khond by giving a
feast. As might be expected the tribe are closely connected with the
Gaurs or Uriya shepherds, whose business leads them to frequent the
forests. Either a man or woman of the Gaurs can be taken into the
community on marrying a Khond, and if a Khond girl marries a Gaur her
children, though not herself, can become members of that caste. The
Khonds will eat all kinds of animals, including rats, snakes and
lizards, but with the exception of the Kutia Khonds they have now given
up beef. In K&#257;l&#257;handi social delinquencies are punished by a
fine of so many field-mice, which the Khond considers a great delicacy.
The catching of twenty to forty field-mice to liquidate the fine
imposes on the culprit a large amount of trouble and labour, and when
his task is completed his friends and neighbours fry the mice and have
a feast with plenty of liquor, but he himself is not allowed to
participate. Khond women are profusely tattooed with figures of trees,
flowers, fishes, crocodiles, lizards and scorpions on the calf of the
leg and the arms, hands and chest, but seldom on the face. This is done
for purposes of ornament. Husband and wife do not mention each
other&rsquo;s names, and a woman may not speak the names of any of her
husband&rsquo;s younger brothers, as, if left a widow, she might
subsequently have to marry one of them. A paternal or maternal aunt may
not name her nephew, nor a man his younger brother&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<h3 class="main">10. Festivals.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tribe have three principal festivals, known as the
Semi J&#257;tra, the M&#257;hul J&#257;tra and the Ch&#257;wal
Dh&#363;ba J&#257;tra. The Semi J&#257;tra is held on the tenth day of
the waning moon of Aghan (November) when the new <i>semi</i> or country
beans are roasted, a goat or fowl is sacrificed, and some milk or water
is offered to the earth god. From this day the tribe commence eating
the new crop of beans. Similarly the M&#257;hul J&#257;tra is held on
the tenth of the waning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb473" href=
"#pb473" name="pb473">473</a>]</span>moon of Chait (March), and until
this date a Khond may eat boiled mahua flowers, but not roasted ones.
The principal festival is the Dasahra or Ch&#257;wal Dh&#363;ba (boiled
rice) on the tenth day of the waning moon of Kunw&#257;r (September),
which, in the case of the Khonds, marks the rice-harvest. The new rice
is washed and boiled and offered to the earth god with the same
accompaniment as in the case of the Semi J&#257;tra, and until this
date the Khond may not clean the new rice by washing it before being
boiled, though he apparently may partake of it so long as it is not
washed or cleaned, this rule and that regarding the mahua flowers being
so made as concessions to convenience.</p>

<h3 class="main">11. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Khond pantheon consists of eighty-four gods, of
whom Dharni Deota, the earth god, is the chief. In former times the
earth goddess was apparently female and was known as T&#257;ri Pennu or
Bera Pennu. To her were offered the terrible human sacrifices presently
to be described. There is nothing surprising in the change of sex of
the divine being, for which parallels are forthcoming. Thus in
Chhatt&#299;sgarh the deity of the earth, who also received human
sacrifices, is either Th&#257;kur Deo, a god, or Thakur&#257;ni Mai, a
goddess. Deota is an Aryan term, and the proper Khond name for a god is
Pennu. The earth god is usually accompanied by Bh&#257;tbarsi Deota,
the god of hunting. Dharni Deota is represented by a rectangular peg of
wood driven into the ground, while Bh&#257;tbarsi has a place at his
feet in the shape of a piece of conglomerate stone covered with
circular granules. Once in four or five years a buffalo is offered to
the earth god, in lieu of the human sacrifice which was formerly in
vogue. The animal is predestined for sacrifice from its birth, and is
allowed to wander loose and graze on the crops at its will. The stone
representing Bh&#257;tbarsi is examined periodically, and when the
granules on it appear to have increased, it is decided that the time
has come for the sacrifice. In K&#257;l&#257;handi a lamb is sacrificed
every year, and strips of its flesh distributed to all the villagers,
who bury it in their fields as a divine agent of fertilisation, in the
same way as the flesh of the human victim was formerly buried. The
Khond worships his bow and arrows before he goes out hunting, and
believes that every hill and valley has its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb474" href="#pb474" name=
"pb474">474</a>]</span>separate deity, who must be propitiated with the
promise of a sacrifice before his territory is entered, or he will hide
the animals within it from the hunter, and enable them to escape when
wounded. These deities are closely related to each other, and it is
important when arranging for an expedition to know the connection
between them all; this information can be obtained from any one on whom
the divine afflatus from time to time descends.</p>

<h3 class="main">12. Human sacrifice.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following account of the well-known system of
human sacrifice, formerly in vogue among the Khonds, is contained in
Sir James Frazer&rsquo;s <i>Golden Bough</i>, having been compiled by
him from the accounts of Major Macpherson and Major-General John
Campbell, two of the officers deputed to suppress it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best known case of human sacrifices systematically
offered to ensure good crops is supplied by the Khonds or Kandhs,
another Dravidian race in Bengal. Our knowledge of them is derived from
the accounts written by British officers who, forty or fifty years ago,
were engaged in putting them down. The sacrifices were offered to the
Earth-Goddess, T&#257;ri Pennu or Bera Pennu, and were believed to
ensure good crops and immunity from all disease and accidents. In
particular they were considered necessary in the cultivation of
turmeric, the Khonds arguing that the turmeric could not have a deep
red colour without the shedding of blood. The victim or Meri&#257;h was
acceptable to the goddess only if he had been purchased, or had been
born a victim&mdash;that is the son of a victim father&mdash;or had
been devoted as a child by his father or guardian. Khonds in distress
often sold their children for victims, &lsquo;considering the
beatification of their souls certain, and their death, for the benefit
of mankind, the most honourable possible.&rsquo; A man of the Panua
(P&#257;n) tribe was once seen to load a Khond with curses, and finally
to spit in his face, because the Khond had sold for a victim his own
child, whom the Panua had wished to marry. A party of Khonds, who saw
this, immediately pressed forward to comfort the seller of his child,
saying, &lsquo;Your child has died that all the world may live, and the
Earth-Goddess herself will wipe that spittle from your face.&rsquo; The
victims were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href="#pb475" name=
"pb475">475</a>]</span>often kept for years before they were
sacrificed. Being regarded as consecrated beings, they were treated
with extreme affection, mingled with deference, and were welcomed
wherever they went. A Meri&#257;h youth, on attaining maturity, was
generally given a wife, who was herself usually a Meri&#257;h or
victim, and with her he received a portion of land and farm-stock.
Their offspring were also victims. Human sacrifices were offered to the
Earth-Goddess by tribes, branches of tribes, or villages, both at
periodical festivals and on extraordinary occasions. The periodical
sacrifices were generally so arranged by tribes and divisions of tribes
that each head of a family was enabled, at least once a year, to
procure a shred of flesh for his fields, generally about the time when
his chief crop was laid down. The mode of performing these tribal
sacrifices was as follows. Ten or twelve days before the sacrifice, the
victim was devoted by cutting off his hair, which, until then, had been
kept unshorn. Crowds of men and women assembled to witness the
sacrifice; none might be excluded, since the sacrifice was declared to
be for all mankind. It was preceded by several days of wild revelry and
gross debauchery. On the day before the sacrifice the victim, dressed
in a new garment, was led forth from the village in solemn procession,
with music and dancing, to the Meri&#257;h grove, a clump of high
forest trees standing a little way from the village and untouched by
the axe. Here they tied him to a post, which was sometimes placed
between two plants of the <i>sankiss&#257;r</i> shrub. He was then
anointed with oil, ghee and turmeric, and adorned with flowers; and
&lsquo;a species of reverence, which it is not easy to distinguish from
adoration,&rsquo; was paid to him throughout the day. A great struggle
now arose to obtain the smallest relic from his person; a particle of
the turmeric paste with which he was smeared, or a drop of his spittle,
was esteemed of sovereign virtue, especially by the women. The crowd
danced round the post to music, and addressing the Earth said, &lsquo;O
God, we offer this sacrifice to you; give us good crops, seasons, and
health.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the last morning the orgies, which had been scarcely
interrupted during the night, were resumed and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476" name=
"pb476">476</a>]</span>continued till noon, when they ceased, and the
assembly proceeded to consummate the sacrifice. The victim was again
anointed with oil, and each person touched the anointed part, and wiped
the oil on his own head. In some places they took the victim in
procession round the village, from door to door, where some plucked
hair from his head, and others begged for a drop of his spittle, with
which they anointed their heads. As the victim might not be bound nor
make any show of resistance, the bones of his arms and, if necessary,
his legs were broken; but often this precaution was rendered
unnecessary by stupefying him with opium. The mode of putting him to
death varied in different places. One of the commonest modes seems to
have been strangulation, or squeezing to death. The branch of a green
tree was cleft several feet down the middle; the victim&rsquo;s neck
(in other places, his chest) was inserted in the cleft, which the
priest, aided by his assistants, strove with all his force to close.
Then he wounded the victim slightly with his axe, whereupon the crowd
rushed at the wretch and cut the flesh from the bones, leaving the head
and bowels untouched. Sometimes he was cut up alive. In Chinna Kimedy
he was dragged along the fields, surrounded by the crowd, who, avoiding
his head and intestines, hacked the flesh from his body with their
knives till he died. Another very common mode of sacrifice in the same
district was to fasten the victim to the proboscis of a wooden
elephant, which revolved on a stout post, and, as it whirled round, the
crowd cut the flesh from the victim while life remained. In some
villages Major Campbell found as many as fourteen of these wooden
elephants, which had been used at sacrifices.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e15641src" href="#xd21e15641" name="xd21e15641src">7</a> In one
district the victim was put to death slowly by fire. A low stage was
formed, sloping on either side like a roof; upon it they laid the
victim, his limbs wound round with cords to confine his struggles.
Fires were then lighted and hot brands applied, to make him roll up and
down the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb477" href="#pb477" name=
"pb477">477</a>]</span>slopes of the stage as long as possible; for the
more tears he shed the more abundant would be the supply of rain. Next
day the body was cut to pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flesh cut from the victim was instantly taken home by the
persons who had been deputed by each village to bring it. To secure its
rapid arrival it was sometimes forwarded by relays of men, and conveyed
with postal fleetness fifty or sixty miles. In each village all who
stayed at home fasted rigidly until the flesh arrived. The bearer
deposited it in the place of public assembly, where it was received by
the priest and the heads of families. The priest divided it into two
portions, one of which he offered to the Earth-Goddess by burying it in
a hole in the ground with his back turned, and without looking. Then
each man added a little earth to bury it, and the priest poured water
on the spot from a hill gourd. The other portion of flesh he divided
into as many shares as there were heads of houses present. Each head of
a house rolled his shred of flesh in leaves and buried it in his
favourite field, placing it in the earth behind his back without
looking. In some places each man carried his portion of flesh to the
stream which watered his fields, and there hung it on a pole. For three
days thereafter no house was swept; and, in one district, strict
silence was observed, no fire might be given out, no wood cut, and no
strangers received. The remains of the human victim (namely, the head,
bowels and bones) were watched by strong parties the night after the
sacrifice, and next morning they were burned along with a whole sheep,
on a funeral pile. The ashes were scattered over the fields, laid as
paste over the houses and granaries, or mixed with the new corn to
preserve it from insects. Sometimes, however, the head and bones were
buried, not burnt. After the suppression of the human sacrifices,
inferior victims were substituted in some places; for instance, in the
capital of Chinna Kimedy a goat took the place of a human victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these Khond sacrifices the Meri&#257;hs are represented by
our authorities as victims offered to propitiate the Earth-Goddess. But
from the treatment of the victims both before and after death it
appears that the custom cannot <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb478"
href="#pb478" name="pb478">478</a>]</span>be explained as merely a
propitiatory sacrifice. A part of the flesh certainly was offered to
the Earth-Goddess, but the rest of the flesh was buried by each
householder in his fields, and the ashes of the other parts of the body
were scattered over the fields, laid as paste on the granaries, or
mixed with the new corn. These latter customs imply that to the body of
the Meri&#257;h there was ascribed a direct or intrinsic power of
making the crops to grow, quite independent of the indirect efficacy
which it might have as an offering to secure the good-will of the
deity. In other words, the flesh and ashes of the victim were believed
to be endowed with a magical or physical power of fertilising the land.
The same intrinsic power was ascribed to the blood and tears of the
Meri&#257;h, his blood causing the redness of the turmeric, and his
tears producing rain; for it can hardly be doubted that, originally at
least, the tears were supposed to bring down the rain, not merely to
prognosticate it. Similarly the custom of pouring water on the buried
flesh of the Meri&#257;h was no doubt a rain-charm. Again, magical
power as an attribute of the Meri&#257;h appears in the sovereign
virtue believed to reside in anything that came from his person, as his
hair or spittle. The ascription of such power to the Meri&#257;h
indicates that he was much more than a mere man sacrificed to
propitiate a deity. Once more, the extreme reverence paid him points to
the same conclusion. Major Campbell speaks of the Meri&#257;h as
&lsquo;being regarded as something more than mortal,&rsquo; and Major
Macpherson says: &lsquo;A species of reverence, which it is not easy to
distinguish from adoration, is paid to him.&rsquo; In short, the
Meri&#257;h appears to have been regarded as divine. As such, he may
originally have represented the Earth-Goddess, or perhaps a deity of
vegetation, though in later times he came to be regarded rather as a
victim offered to a deity than as himself an incarnate god. This later
view of the Meri&#257;h as a victim rather than a divinity may perhaps
have received undue emphasis from the European writers who have
described the Khond religion. Habituated to the later idea of sacrifice
as an offering made to a god for the purpose of conciliating his
favour, European observers are apt to interpret all religious slaughter
in this sense, and to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb479" href=
"#pb479" name="pb479">479</a>]</span>suppose that wherever such
slaughter takes place, there must necessarily be a deity to whom the
carnage is believed by the slayers to be acceptable. Thus their
preconceived ideas unconsciously colour and warp their descriptions of
savage rites.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15654src" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In his <i>Ethnographic Notes in Southern India</i> Mr.
Thurston states:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15669src" href=
"#xd21e15669" name="xd21e15669src">9</a> &ldquo;The last recorded
Meri&#257;h sacrifice in the Ganjam M&#257;li&#257;hs occurred in 1852,
and there are still Khonds alive who were present at it. Twenty-five
descendants of persons who were reserved for sacrifice, but were
rescued by Government officers, returned themselves as Meri&#257;h at
the Census of 1901. The Khonds have now substituted a buffalo for a
human being. The animal is hewn to pieces while alive, and the
villagers rush home to their villages to bury the flesh in the soil,
and so secure prosperous crops. The sacrifice is not unaccompanied by
risk to the performers, as the buffalo, before dying, frequently kills
one or more of its tormentors. It was stated by the officers of the
M&#257;li&#257;h Agency that there was reason to believe that the
R&#257;ja of Jaipur (Madras), when he was installed at his
father&rsquo;s decease in 1860&ndash;61, sacrificed a girl thirteen
years of age at the shrine of the Goddess Durga in the town of Jaipur.
The last attempted human sacrifice (which was nearly successful) in the
Vizag&#257;patam District, among the Kutia Khonds, was, I believe, in
1880. But the memory of the abandoned practice is kept green by one of
the Khond songs, for a translation of which we are indebted to Mr. J.

<h3 class="main">14. Khond rising in 1882.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In 1882 an armed rising of the Khonds of the
K&#257;l&#257;handi State occurred as a result of agrarian trouble. The
Feudatory Chief had encouraged the settlement in the State of members
of the Kolta caste who are excellent cultivators and keenly acquisitive
of land. They soon got the Khonds heavily indebted to them for loans of
food and seed-grain, and began to oust them from their villages. The
Khonds, recognising with some justice that this process was likely to
end in their total expropriation from the soil, concerted a conspiracy,
and in May 1882 rose and murdered the Koltas of a number of villages.
The signal for the outbreak was given by passing a knotted string from
village to village; other signals were a bent arrow and a branch of a
<i>mahua</i> tree. When the Khond leaders were assembled an axe was
thrown on to the ground and each of them grasping it in turn swore to
join in the rising and support his fellows. The taint of cruelty in the
tribe is shown by the fact that the Kutia Khonds, on being requested to
join in the rising, replied that if plunder was the only object they
would not do so, but if the Koltas were to be murdered they agreed.
Some of the murdered Koltas were anointed with turmeric and offered at
temples, the Khonds calling them their goats, and in one case a Kolta
is believed to have been made a Meri&#257;h sacrifice to the earth god.
The Khonds appeared before the police, who were protecting a body of
refugees at the village of Norla, with the hair and scalps of their
murdered victims tied to their bows. To the Political Officer, who was
sent to suppress the rising, the Khonds complained that the Koltas had
degraded them from the position of lords of the soil to that of
servants, and justified their plundering of the Koltas on the ground
that they were merely taking back the produce of their own land, which
the Koltas had stolen from them. They said that if they were not to
have back their land Government might either drive them out of the
country or exterminate them, and that Koltas and Khonds could no more
live together than tigers and goats. Another grievance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481" name="pb481">481</a>]</span>was
that a new R&#257;ja of K&#257;l&#257;handi had been installed without
their consent having been obtained. The Political Officer, Mr. Berry,
hanged seven of the Khond ringleaders and effected a settlement of
their grievances. Peace was restored and has not since been broken. At
a later date in the same year, 1882, and independently of the rising, a
Khond landholder was convicted and executed for having offered a
five-year-old girl as a Meri&#257;h sacrifice.</p>

found principally in the Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d District. They numbered
about 7000 persons in 1911. The K&#299;rs claim to have come from the
Jaipur State, and this is borne out by the fact that they still retain
a dialect of M&#257;rw&#257;ri, though they have been living among the
Hindi-speaking population of Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d for several
generations. According to their traditions they immigrated into the
Central Provinces when R&#257;ja M&#257;n was ruling at Jaipur. He was
a contemporary of Akbar&rsquo;s and died in <span class=

Kir&#257;rs they claim to be descended from the mythical R&#257;ja
Karan of Jaipur. Their story is that on a summer day Mah&#257;deo and
P&#257;rvati created a melon-garden, and Mah&#257;deo made a man and a
woman out of a piece of <i>kusha</i> grass (<i>Eragrostis
cynosuroides</i>) to tend the garden. From these the K&#299;rs are
descended. The name may possibly be a corruption of <i>karar</i>, a
river-bank.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The K&#299;rs have no endogamous divisions. For the
purpose of marriage the caste is divided into 12&frac12; <i>gotras</i>
or sections. A man must not marry within his own <i>gotra</i> or in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb482" href="#pb482" name=
"pb482">482</a>]</span>that to which his mother belonged. The names of
the 12 <i>gotras</i> are as follows: Namchuria, Daima, Bania,
B&#257;man, N&#257;yar, J&#257;t, Huw&#257;d, G&#257;dri, Loh&#257;ria,
Hekdya, Mochi and M&#257;li, while the half-<i>gotra</i> contains the
Bh&#257;ts or genealogists of the caste, who are not allowed to marry
with the other subdivisions and have now formed one of their own. Of
the twelve names of <i>gotras</i> at least seven&mdash;B&#257;man
(Br&#257;hman), Bania, M&#257;li, Mochi, G&#257;dri (Gadaria),
Loh&#257;ria and J&#257;t&mdash;are derived from other castes, and this
fact is sufficient to show that the origin of the K&#299;rs is
occupational, and that they are made up of recruits from different
castes. Infant-marriage is customary, but no penalty is incurred if a
girl remains unmarried after puberty. Only the poorest members of the
caste, however, fail to marry their daughters at an early age. For the
marriage of girls who are left unprovided for, a subscription is raised
among the caste-fellows in accordance with the usual Hindu practice,
the giving of money for this purpose being considered to be an
especially pious act. At the time of the betrothal a bride-price called
<i>ch&#257;ri</i>, varying between Rs. 14 and Rs. 20, is paid by the
boy&rsquo;s father, and the deed of betrothal, called <i>lagan</i>, is
then drawn up in the presence of the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> who
are regaled with liquor purchased out of the bride-price. A peculiarity
of the marriage ceremony is that the bridegroom is taken to the
bride&rsquo;s house riding on a buffalo. This custom is noteworthy,
since other Hindus will not usually ride on a buffalo, as being the
animal on which Yama, the god of death, rides. After the marriage the
bride returns to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house with the wedding party
and stays there for eight days, during which period she worships the
family gods of her father-in-law&rsquo;s house. The cost of the
marriage is usually Rs. 60 for the boy&rsquo;s party and Rs. 40 for the
girl&rsquo;s. But a widower on his remarriage has to spend double this
sum. The ceremonies called Gauna and Rauna are both performed after the
marriage. The former generally takes place within a year, the bride
being dressed in special new clothes called <i>bes</i>, and sent with
ceremony to her husband&rsquo;s house on an auspicious day fixed by a
Br&#257;hman. She remains there for two months and the marriage is
consummated, when she returns to her father&rsquo;s house. Four months
afterwards the bridegroom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb483" href=
"#pb483" name="pb483">483</a>]</span>again goes to fetch her and takes
her away permanently, this being the Rauna ceremony. No social stigma
attaches to polygamy, and divorce is allowed on the usual grounds.
Widow-marriage is permitted, the ceremony consisting in giving new
clothes and ornaments to the widow and feeding the Panch for a day.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste worships especially Bhairon and Devi, and
each section of it reveres a special incarnation of Devi, and the
Bhairon of some particular village. Thus, for instance, the Namchurias
worship the goddess P&#257;rvati and the Bhairon of Jaria Gow&#257;ra;
the Bania, N&#257;yar, Hekdya and Mochi septs worship Ch&#257;munda
M&#257;ta and the Bhairon of Jaipur, and so on. Members of the caste
get triangular, rectangular or round pieces of silver impressed with
the images of these gods, and wear them suspended by a thread from
their necks. A similar respect is paid to the Ahut or the spirit of a
relative who has met with a violent death or died without progeny or as
a bachelor, the spirits of such persons being always prone to trouble
their living relatives. In order to appease them songs are sung in
their praise on important festivals, the members of the family staying
awake the whole night, and wearing their images on a silver piece round
the neck. When they eat and drink they first touch the food with the
image by way of offering it to the dead, so that their spirits may be
appeased and refrain from harassing the living. K&#299;rs revere and
worship the cow and the p&#299;pal tree. No K&#299;r may sell a cow to
a butcher. A man who is about to die makes a present of a cow to a
Br&#257;hman or a temple in order that by catching hold of the tail of
this cow he may be able to cross the horrible river Vaitarni, the Styx
of Hinduism, which bars the passage to the nether regions. The
K&#299;rs believe in magic, and some members of the caste profess to
cure snake-bite. The poison-curer, when sent for, has a small space
cleared and plastered with cowdung, on which he draws lines with wheat
flour. A new earthen pot is then brought and placed over the drawing.
On the pot the operator draws a figure of Hanum&#257;n in vermilion,
and another figure on the nearest wall facing the pot. A brass plate is
put over the pot and the person who has been bitten by the snake is
brought near it<span class="corr" id="xd21e15795" title=
"Not in source">.</span> The snake-charmer <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb484" href="#pb484" name="pb484">484</a>]</span>then
begins to name various gods and goddesses and to play upon the plate,
which emits, it is said, a very melancholy sound. This performance is
called <i>bharni</i> and is supposed to charm all beings, even gods and
serpents. The snake who has inflicted the bite is then believed to
appear in an invisible form to listen to the <i>bharni</i>, and to
enter into the sufferer. The sufferer is questioned, being supposed to
be possessed by the snake, and asked why the bite was inflicted and how
the snake can be appeased. The replies are thought to be given by the
snake, who explains that he was trampled on, or something to that
effect, and asks that milk or some sweet-smelling article be placed at
his hole. The offering is promised, and the snake is asked not to kill
the sufferer, to which he agrees. The snake usually gives the history
of his former human birth, stating his name and village and the cause
of his transmigration into the body of a serpent. The K&#299;rs believe
that human beings who commit offences are re-born as snakes, and they
think that snakes live for a thousand years. After giving this
information the snake departs, and the person who has been bitten is
supposed to recover. The chief festivals of the K&#299;rs are
Diw&#257;li and Sitala Ath&#257;in. They worship their ancestors at
Diw&#257;li, making offerings of cooked food, <i>kusha</i> grass and
lamps made of dough at the river-side. The head of the family sprinkles
water and throws the <i>kusha</i> grass into the river, lights the
wicks placed in the lamps and burns a little food in them, calling on
the names of his ancestors. The rest of the food he takes home and
distributes to his caste-fellows. Sitala Ath&#257;in is observed on the
seventh day of the dark fortnight of Chait. Devi is worshipped at night
with offerings of milk and whey, and on the next day no food is cooked,
the remains of that of the previous day being eaten cold, and the whole
day is devoted to singing the praises of the goddess.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The K&#299;rs usually burn their dead, but children
under twelve are buried. The ashes and bones are either sent to the
Ganges or consigned to the nearest river or lake. Children have only
one name, which is given on the seventh day after birth by a
Br&#257;hman. During the birth ceremony the husband&rsquo;s younger
brother catches hold of the skirt of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb485" href="#pb485" name="pb485">485</a>]</span>child&rsquo;s mother,
who on this pays him a few pice and pulls away her cloth. If this
custom has any meaning it is apparently in symbolical memory of
polyandry, the women bribing her husband&rsquo;s younger brother so
that he may not claim the child as his own.</p>

<h3 class="main">5. Food, dress and occupation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The K&#299;rs do not take food from any caste except
the Dadh&#257;ria Br&#257;hmans, who are M&#257;rw&#257;ris, and act as
their family priests. Br&#257;hmans and other high castes will drink
water brought in a brass vessel by a K&#299;r. The K&#299;rs eat no
meat except goats&rsquo; flesh and fish, but are much addicted to
liquor, which is always conspicuous at their feasts and festivals. They
have a caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i>, which deals with the ordinary
offences. Temporary excommunication is removed by the offender giving
three feasts, on which an amount varying with his social position and
means must be expended. The first of these is eaten on a river-bank,
the second in a garden, and the third, which confers complete
readmission to caste intercourse, in the offender&rsquo;s house. The
K&#299;rs live along river-banks, where they grow melons in the sand
and castor and vegetables in alluvial soil. They are considered very
skilful at raising these crops, and fully appreciate the use of manure.
For their own consumption they usually grow <i>b&#257;jra</i> and
<i>arhar</i>, being, like all M&#257;rw&#257;ris, very fond of
<i>b&#257;jra</i>. The members of the caste are easily distinguished by
their dress, the men wearing a white <i>mirzai</i> or short coat, a
<i>dhoti</i> reaching to the knees, and a head-cloth placed in a
crooked position on the head, so as to leave the hair of the scalp
uncovered. They wear necklaces of black wooden beads, besides the
images of Bhairon and Devi. The women wear Jaipur <i>chunris</i> or
over-cloths and <i>gh&#257;nghras</i> or skirts. They have red lac
bangles on their wrists and arms above the elbow, and ornaments called
<i>ramjhul</i> on their legs. The women have a gait like that of men.
The speech of the K&#299;rs sounds like M&#257;rw&#257;ri, and they are
peculiar in their preference for riding on buffaloes.</p>

Seoni, Chhindw&#257;ra and N&#257;gpur Districts. They numbered 48,000
persons in 1911. The Kir&#257;rs claim to be Dh&#257;kar or bastard
R&#257;jp&#363;ts, and in 1891 more than half of them returned
themselves under this designation. About a thousand persons who were
returned as Dh&#257;kar R&#257;jp&#363;ts from Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d in
1901 are probably Kir&#257;rs. The caste say that they immigrated from
Gw&#257;lior, and this statement seems to be correct, as about 66,000
of them are found in that State. They claim to have left Gw&#257;lior
as early as Samvat 1525 or <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1468, when Alru
and Dalru, the leaders of the migration into the Central Provinces,
abandoned their native village, Doderi Kheda in Gw&#257;lior, and
settled in Ch&#257;ndon, a village in the Soh&#257;gpur tahs&#299;l of
Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d. But according to the story related to Mr. (Sir
Charles) Elliott, the migration took place in <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 1650 or at the beginning of Aur&#257;ngzeb&rsquo;s
reign.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15874src" href="#xd21e15874" name=
"xd21e15874src">2</a> He quotes the names of the leaders as
Alr&#257;wat and Dalr&#257;wat, and says that the migration took place
from the Dholpur country, but this is probably a mistake, as none of
the caste are now found in Dholpur. Elliott stated that he could find
no traces of any cultivating caste having settled in
Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d as far back as Akbar&rsquo;s time, though Sir W.
Sleeman was of opinion that the first great migration into the Nerbudda
valley took place in that reign. The truth is probably that the valley
began to be regularly colonised by Hindus during the years that
Aur&#257;ngzeb spent at Burh&#257;npur and in the Deccan, and the
immigration of the Kir&#257;rs may most reasonably be attributed to
this period. The Kir&#257;rs, G&#363;jars, and R&#257;ghuvansis
apparently entered the Central Provinces together, and the fact that
they still smoke from the same huqqa and take water from each
other&rsquo;s drinking vessels may be a reminiscence of this bond of
fellowship. All these castes claim, and probably with truth, to be
degraded R&#257;jp&#363;ts. The Kir&#257;rs&rsquo; version is that they
took to widow-marriage and were consequently degraded. According to
another story they were driven from their native place by a Muhammadan
invasion. Mr. J. D. Cunningham says that the word <i>Kir&#257;r</i> in
Central India literally means dalesmen or foresters, but during the
lapse <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb487" href="#pb487" name=
"pb487">487</a>]</span>of centuries has become the name of a
caste.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15885src" href="#xd21e15885" name=
"xd21e15885src">3</a> Another derivation is from Kir&#257;r, a
corn-chandler, an occupation which they may originally have followed in
combination with agriculture. In the Punjab the name Kir&#257;r appears
to be given to all the western or Punjabi traders as distinct from a
Bania of Hindust&#257;n, and is so used even in the K&#257;ngra hills,
but the Arora, who is the trader <i>par excellence</i> of the
south-west of the Punjab, is the person to whom the term is most
commonly applied.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15893src" href=
"#xd21e15893" name="xd21e15893src">4</a> As a curiosity of
folk-etymology it may be stated that some derive the caste-name from
the fact that a holy sage&rsquo;s wife, who was about to be delivered
of a child, was being pursued by a R&#257;kshas or demon, and fell over
the steep bank (<i>kar&#257;r</i>) of a river and was thereupon
delivered. The child was consequently called Kar&#257;r and became the
ancestor of the Kir&#257;r caste. The name may in fact be derived from
the habit which the Kir&#257;rs have in some localities of cultivating
on the banks of rivers, like the K&#299;rs, who are probably a branch
of the same caste.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Central Provinces the Kir&#257;rs have no
regular subcastes. In Chhindw&#257;ra a subdivision is in course of
formation from the illegitimate offspring of male Kir&#257;rs, who are
known as Vid&#363;r or Saoneria. The Dh&#257;kar Kir&#257;rs do not
marry or eat with Saonerias. The section-names of the Kir&#257;rs are
not eponymous, as might be anticipated from their claim to
R&#257;jp&#363;t descent, but they are generally territorial. Instances
are Bankhedi, from Bankhedi, a village in Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d;
Garhya, from Garha, near Jubbulpore; and Teharia, from Tehri, a State
in Bundelkhand. Other section-names are Chaudharia, from Chaudhari,
headman; Khandait or swordsman, and B&#257;nda, or tailless. Some
<i>gotras</i> are derived from the names of other castes or subcastes,
or of R&#257;jp&#363;t septs, as Loh&#257;ria, from Loh&#257;r
(blacksmith); Chauria, a subcaste of Kurmis; Lilorhia, a subcaste of
G&#363;jars; and Solank&#299; and Chauh&#257;n, the names of
R&#257;jp&#363;t septs. These names may probably be taken to indicate
the mixed origin of the caste, and record the admission of families
from other castes. A man cannot <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb488"
href="#pb488" name="pb488">488</a>]</span>marry in his own <i>gotra</i>
nor in the families of his grandmother, paternal uncle or maternal aunt
to three degrees of consanguinity. Boys and girls are usually married
between the ages of five and twelve. Marriages take place so long as
the planet Venus or Shukra is visible at nights, <i>i.e.</i> between
the months of Aghan (November) and As&#257;rh (June). The proposal for
marriage proceeds from the boy&rsquo;s father, who ascertains the
wishes of the girl&rsquo;s father through a barber. If the latter is
willing, the Sagai or betrothal ceremony is performed at the
girl&rsquo;s house. The boy&rsquo;s father proceeds there with a rupee,
two pice and a cocoanut-core, which he presents to the girl, taking her
into his lap. The fathers of the boy and girl embrace, and this seals
the compact of betrothal. The date of the marriage is usually fixed in
consultation with a Br&#257;hman, who computes an auspicious day from
the ceremonial names of the couple. But if it is desired to perform the
marriage at once, it may take place on Akh&#257;t&#299;j, or the third
day of the bright fortnight of Bais&#257;kh (April&ndash;May), which is
always auspicious. The <i>lagan</i> or paper containing the date of the
marriage is drawn up ceremonially by a Br&#257;hman of the girl&rsquo;s
house, and he also writes another, giving the names of the relatives
who are selected to officiate at the ceremony. The first ceremony at
the marriage is that of M&#257;ngar M&#257;ti, or bringing earth for
ovens, the earth being worshipped by a burnt offering of butter and
sugar, and then dug up by the Saw&#257;sin or girl&rsquo;s attendant
for the marriage, and carried home by several women in baskets. This is
done in the morning, and in the evening the boy and girl in their
respective houses are anointed with oil and turmeric, a little being
first thrown on the ground for the family gods. This ceremony is
repeated every evening for some three to fifteen days. The
<i>mandwa</i> or marriage-shed is then erected at both houses, under
which the ceremony of <i>tel</i> or touching the feet<span class="corr"
id="xd21e15927" title="Not in source">,</span> knees, shoulders and
forehead of the boy and the girl with oil is performed. Next day the
<i>kh&#257;m</i> or marriage-post is placed in the <i>mandwa</i>, a
little rice, turmeric and two pice being put in the hole in which it is
fixed, and the shed is covered with leaves. The bridegroom, clad in a
blanket and with date-leaves tied on his head, is taken out for the
<i>binaiki</i> or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb489" href="#pb489"
name="pb489">489</a>]</span>the marriage procession on horseback.
Before mounting, he bows to M&#257;ta or Devi, Mah&#257;b&#299;r,
Hardaul L&#257;la, and Patel Deo, the spirit of the deceased
m&#257;lguz&#257;r of the village. He is taken round to the houses of
friends and relatives, who present him with a few pice. On his return
he bathes and puts on the marriage dress, which consists of a red or
yellow <i>j&#257;ma</i> or gown, a pair of trousers, a pagr&#299;, a
<i>maur</i> or marriage crown and a cloth about his waist. A few
women&rsquo;s ornaments are put on his neck, and he is furnished with a
<i>kat&#257;r</i> or dagger, and in its absence a nutcracker or knife.
He then comes out of the house and the <i>parchhan</i> ceremony is
performed, the boy&rsquo;s mother putting her nipple in his mouth and
giving him a little <i>gh&#299;</i> and sugar to eat as a symbol of the
termination of his infancy. The Bar&#257;t or marriage procession then
sets out for the girl&rsquo;s village, being met on its outskirts by
the bride&rsquo;s father, and the forehead of the bridegroom is marked
with sandalwood paste. The bridegroom touches the Mandwa with his hand
or throws a bamboo fan over it and returns with his followers to the
Janw&#257;sa or lodging given to the Bar&#257;t. Next morning the
ceremony of Chadhao or decorating the bride is performed, and the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party give her the clothes and ornaments which they
have brought for her, these being first offered to an image of Ganesh
made of cowdung. The bride is then mounted on a horse provided by the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party and goes round to the houses of the friends of
the family, accompanied by music and the women of her party, and
receives small presents. The <i>Bh&#257;nwar</i> ceremony is performed
during the night, the couple being seated near the marriage-post with
their backs to the house. A ball of kneaded flour is put in the
girl&rsquo;s right hand, which is then placed on the right hand of the
bridegroom, and the bride&rsquo;s brother pours water over their hands.
The bride&rsquo;s maternal uncle and aunt, with the skirts of their
clothes tied together, step forward and wash the feet of the couple and
give them presents. The other relatives follow suit, and this completes
the ceremony of Paon Pakhurai or Daija, that is giving the dowry. The
couple then go round the marriage-post seven times, the girl leading
for the first four rounds and the boy for the last three. This is the
<i>Bh&#257;nwar</i> ceremony or binding <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb490" href="#pb490" name="pb490">490</a>]</span>portion of the
marriage, and the polar star is called on to make it inviolable. The
bridegroom&rsquo;s party are then feasted, the women meantime singing
obscene songs. The bride goes back to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house and
stays there for a few days, after which she returns to her
parents&rsquo; house and does not leave it again until the <i>gauna</i>
ceremony is performed. On this occasion the bridegroom&rsquo;s party go
to the girl&rsquo;s house with a present of sweets and clothes which
they present to her parents, and they then take away the girl. Even
after this she is again sent back to her parents&rsquo; house, and the
bridegroom comes a second time to fetch her, on which occasion the
parents of the bride have to make a present in return for the sweets
and clothes previously given to them. The marriage expenses are said to
average between Rs. 50 and Rs. 100, but the extravagance of Kir&#257;rs
is notorious. Sir R. Craddock says<a class="noteref" id="xd21e15969src"
href="#xd21e15969" name="xd21e15969src">5</a> that they are much given
to display, the richer members of the caste being heavily weighted with
jewellery, while a well-to-do Kir&#257;r will think nothing of spending
Rs. 1000 on his house, or if he is a landowner Rs. 5000. Extravagance
ruins a great many of the Kir&#257;r community. This statement,
however, perhaps applies to those of the N&#257;gpur District rather
than to their comrades of the Nerbudda valley and Satp&#363;ra
highlands. The remarriage of widows is permitted, and the widow may
marry either her husband&rsquo;s younger brother or any other member of
the caste at her choice. The ceremony takes place at night, the woman
being brought to her husband&rsquo;s house by the back door and given a
new cloth and bangles. Turmeric is then applied to her body, and the
clothes of the couple are tied together. When a bachelor marries a
widow, he must first be married to an <i>akau</i> plant (swallow-wort).
Divorce may be effected for infidelity on the part of the wife or for
serious disagreement. A divorced woman may marry again. Polygamy is
allowed, and in Chhindw&#257;ra is said to be restricted to three
wives, all living within the District, but elsewhere no such limitation
is enforced. A man seldom, however, takes more than one wife, except
for the sake of children.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They worship the ordinary Hindu gods and especially
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb491" href="#pb491" name=
"pb491">491</a>]</span>Devi, to whom they offer female kids. During the
months of Bais&#257;kh and Jeth (April&ndash;June) those living in
Bet&#363;l and Chhindw&#257;ra make a pilgrimage to the N&#257;g Deo or
cobra god, who is supposed to have his seat somewhere on the border of
the two Districts. Every third year they also take their cattle outside
the village, and turning their faces in the direction of the N&#257;g
Deo sprinkle a little water and kill goats and fowls. They worship the
Patel Deo or spirit of the deceased m&#257;lguz&#257;r of the village
only on the occasion of marriages. They consider the service of the
village headman to be their traditional occupation besides agriculture,
and they therefore probably pay this special compliment to the spirit
of their employer. They worship their implements of husbandry on some
convenient day, which must be a Wednesday or a Sunday, after they have
sown the spring crops. Those who grow sugarcane offer a goat or a
cocoanut to the crop before it is cut, and a similar offering is made
to the stock of grain after harvest, so that its bulk may not decrease.
They observe the ordinary festivals, and like other Hindus cease to
observe one on which a death has occurred in the family, until some
happy event such as the birth of a child, or even of a calf, supervenes
on the same day. Unmarried children under seven and persons dying of
smallpox, snake-bite or cholera are buried, and others are either
buried or burnt according to the convenience of the family. Males are
placed on the pyre or in the grave on their faces and females on their
backs, with their feet pointing to the south in each case. In some
places the corpse is buried stark naked, and in others with a piece of
cloth wrapped round it, and two pice are usually placed in the grave to
buy the site. When a corpse is burnt the head is touched with a bamboo
before it is laid on the funeral pyre, by way of breaking it in and
allowing the soul to escape if it has not already done so. For three
days the mourners place food, water and tobacco in cups for the
disembodied soul. Mourning is observed for children for three days and
for adults from seven to ten days. During this period the mourners
refrain from luxurious food such as flesh, turmeric, vegetables, milk
and sweets; they do not wear shoes, nor change their clothes, and males
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb492" href="#pb492" name=
"pb492">492</a>]</span>are not shaved until the last day of mourning.
Balls of rice are then offered to the dead, and the caste people are
feasted. Oblations of water are offered to ancestors in the month of
Kunw&#257;r (September-October).</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste do not admit outsiders. In the matter of
food they eat flesh and fish, but abstain from liquor and from eating
fowls, except in the Mar&#257;tha country. They will take <i>pakka</i>
food or that cooked without water from G&#363;jars, R&#257;ghuvansis
and Lodhis. In the N&#257;gpur country, where the difference between
<i>katcha</i> and <i>pakka</i> food is not usually observed, they will
not take it from any but Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;hmans. Ab&#299;rs and
Dh&#299;mars are said to eat with them, and the northern Br&#257;hmans
will take water from them. They have a caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or
committee with a hereditary president called Sethia, whose business it
is to eat first when admitting a person who has been put out of caste.
Killing a cat or a squirrel, selling a cow to a butcher, growing hemp
or selling shoes are offences which entail temporary excommunication
from caste. A woman who commits adultery with a man of another caste is
permanently excluded. The Kir&#257;rs are tall in stature and well and
stoutly built. They have regular features and are generally of a fair
colour. They are regarded as quarrelsome and untruthful, and as
tyrannical landlords. As agriculturists they are supposed to be of
encroaching tendencies, and the proverbial prayer attributed to them
is, &ldquo;O God, give me two bullocks, and I shall plough up the
common way.&rdquo; Another proverb quoted in Mr. Standen&rsquo;s
<i>Bet&#363;l Settlement Report</i>, in illustration of their avarice,
is &ldquo;If you put a rupee between two Kir&#257;rs, they become like
<i>mast</i> buffaloes in Kunw&#257;r.&rdquo; The men always wear
turbans, while the women may be distinguished in the Mar&#257;tha
country by their adherence to the dress of the northern Districts.
Girls are tattooed on the back of their hands before they begin to live
with their husbands. A woman may not name her husband&rsquo;s elder
brother or even touch his clothes or the vessels in which he has eaten
food. They are not distinguished for cleanliness.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Kohli.</b>&mdash;A small caste of cultivators found
in the Mar&#257;thi-speaking tracts of the Wainganga Valley, comprised
in the Bhand&#257;ra and Ch&#257;nda Districts. They numbered about
26,000 persons in 1911. The Kohlis are a notable caste as being the
builders of the great irrigation reservoirs or tanks, for which the
Wainganga Valley is celebrated. The water is used for irrigating rice
and sugarcane, the latter being the favourite crop of the Kohlis. The
origin of the caste is somewhat doubtful. The name closely resembles
that of the Koiri caste of market-gardeners in northern India; and the
terms Kohiri and Kohli are used there as variations of the caste name
Koiri. The caste themselves have a tradition that they were brought to
Bhand&#257;ra from Ben&#257;res by one of the Gond kings of Ch&#257;nda
on his return from a visit to that place;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16027src" href="#xd21e16027" name="xd21e16027src">1</a> and the
Kohlis of Bhand&#257;ra say that their first settlement in the Central
Provinces was at L&#257;nji, which lies north of Bhand&#257;ra in
B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t. But on the other hand all that is known of
their language, customs, and sept or family names points to a purely
Mar&#257;tha origin, the caste being in all these respects closely
analogous to the Kunbis. The Settlement Officer of Ch&#257;nda, Colonel
Lucie Smith, stated that they thought their forefathers came from the
south. They tie their head-cloths in a similar fashion to the
G&#257;ndlis, who are oilmen from the Telugu country. If they belonged
to the south of India they might be an offshoot from the well-known
Koli tribe of Bombay, and this hypothesis appears the more probable. As
a general rule castes from northern India settling in the Mar&#257;tha
country have not completely abandoned their ancestral language and
customs even after a residence of several centuries. In the case of
such castes as the Panw&#257;rs and Bhoyars their foreign extraction
can be detected at once; and if the Kohlis had come from Hindust&#257;n
the rule would probably hold good with them. On <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb494" href="#pb494" name="pb494">494</a>]</span>the
other hand the Kolis have in some parts of Bombay now taken to
cultivation and closely resemble the Kunbis. In Sat&#257;ra it is
said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16035src" href="#xd21e16035" name=
"xd21e16035src">2</a> that they associate and occasionally eat with
Kunbis, and their social and religious customs resemble those of the
Kunbi caste. They are quiet, orderly, settled and hard-working. Besides
fishing they work ferries along the Krishna, are employed in villages
as water-carriers, and grow melons in river-beds with much skill. The
Kolis of Bombay are presumably the same tribe as the Kols of Chota
N&#257;gpur, and they probably migrated to Gujar&#257;t along the
Vindhyan plateau, where they are found in considerable numbers, and
over the hills of R&#257;jput&#257;na and Central India. The Kols are
one of the most adaptive of all the non-Aryan tribes, and when they
reached the sea they may have become fishermen and boatmen, and
practised these callings also in rivers. From plying on rivers they
might take to cultivating melons and garden-crops on the stretches of
silt left uncovered in their beds in the dry season, which is the
common custom of the boating and fishing castes. And from this, as seen
in Sat&#257;ra, some of them attained to regular cultivation and,
modelling themselves on the Kunbis, came to have nearly the same
status. They may thus have migrated to Ch&#257;nda and Bhand&#257;ra
with the Kunbis, as their language and customs would indicate, and
retaining their preference for irrigated and garden-crops have become
expert growers of sugarcane. The description which has been received of
the Kohlis of Bhand&#257;ra would be rather favourable than otherwise
to the hypothesis of their ultimate origin from the Kol tribe, allowing
for their having acquired the Mar&#257;tha language and customs from a
lengthened residence in Bombay. It has been mentioned above that the
Kohlis have a legend of their ancestors having come from Ben&#257;res,
but this story appears to be not infrequently devised as a means of
obtaining increased social estimation, Ben&#257;res being the principal
centre of orthodox Hinduism. Thus the D&#257;ngris, a small caste of
vegetable- and melon-growers who are certainly an offshoot of the
Kunbis, and therefore of Mar&#257;tha extraction, have the same story.
As regards the tradition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb495" href=
"#pb495" name="pb495">495</a>]</span>of the Bhand&#257;ra Kohlis that
their first settlement was at L&#257;nji, this may well have been the
case even though they came from the south, as L&#257;nji was an
important place and a centre of administration under the Mar&#257;thas.
It is probable, however, that they first came to Ch&#257;nda and from
here spread north to L&#257;nji, as, if they had entered Bhand&#257;ra
through Wardha and N&#257;gpur, some of them would probably have
remained in these Districts.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Marriage and other customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kohlis have no subcastes. They are divided into
the usual exogamous groups or septs with the object of preventing
marriages between relations, and these have Mar&#257;thi names of the
territorial or titular type. Among them may be mentioned Handifode (one
who breaks a cooking vessel), Sahre (from <i>shahar</i>, a town),
N&#257;gpure (from N&#257;gpur), Shende (from <i>shend</i>, cowdung),
Parwate (from <i>parwat</i>, mountain), Hatw&#257;de (an obstinate
man), Mungus-m&#257;re (one who killed a mongoose), Pustode (one who
broke a bullock&rsquo;s tail), and so on. Marriage within the sept is
prohibited. A brother&rsquo;s daughter may be married to his
sister&rsquo;s son, but not vice versa. Girls are usually wedded before
arriving at adolescence, more especially as there is a great demand for
brides. Like other castes engaged in spade cultivation, the Kohlis
marry two or more wives when they can afford it, a wife being a more
willing servant than a hired labourer, apart from the other advantages.
If his wives do not get on together, the Kohli gives them separate huts
in his courtyard, where each lives and cooks her meals for herself. He
will also allot them separate tasks, assigning to one the care of his
household affairs, to another the watching of his sugarcane plot, and
so on. If he does this successfully the wives are kept well at work and
have not time to quarrel. It is said that whenever a Kohli has a
bountiful harvest he looks out for another wife. This naturally leads
to a scarcity of women and the payment of a substantial bride-price.
The recognised amount is Rs. 30, but this is only formal, and from Rs.
50 to Rs. 150 may be given according to the attractions of the girl,
the largest sum being paid for a woman of full age who can go and live
with her husband at once. As a consequence of this state of things poor
men are sometimes unable to get wives at all. Though they pay highly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb496" href="#pb496" name=
"pb496">496</a>]</span>for their wives the Kohlis are averse to
extravagant expenditure on weddings, and all marriages in a village are
generally celebrated on the same day once a year, the number of guests
at each being thus necessarily restricted. The officiating Br&#257;hman
ascends the roof of a house and, after beating a brass dish to warn the
parties, repeats the marriage texts as the sun goes down. At this
moment all the couples place garlands of flowers on each other&rsquo;s
shoulders, each bridegroom ties the <i>mangal-s&#363;tram</i> or
necklace of black beads round his bride&rsquo;s neck, and the weddings
are completed. The bride&rsquo;s brother winds a thread round the
marriage crowns of the couple and is given two rupees for untying it.
The services of a Br&#257;hman are not indispensable, and an elder of
the caste may officiate as priest. Next day the barber and washerman
take the bridegroom and bride in their arms and dance, holding them, to
the accompaniment of music, while the women throw red rose-powder over
the couple. At their weddings the Kohlis make models in wood of a
Cham&#257;r&rsquo;s <i>r&#257;mpi</i> or knife and <i>khurpa</i> or
scraper, this custom perhaps indicating some connection with the
Cham&#257;rs; or it may have arisen simply on account of the important
assistance rendered by the Cham&#257;r to the cultivation of sugarcane,
in supplying the <i>mot</i> or leather bag for raising water from the
well. After the wedding is over a string of hemp from a cot is tied
round the necks of the pair, and their maternal uncles then run and
offer it at the shrine of Marai M&#257;ta, the goddess of cholera.
Widows with any remains of youth or personal attractions always marry
again, the ceremony being held at midnight according to the customary
ritual of the Mar&#257;tha Districts.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16079src" href="#xd21e16079" name="xd21e16079src">3</a> Sometimes
the husband does not attend at all, and the widow is united to a sword
or dagger as representing him. Otherwise the widow may be conducted to
her new husband&rsquo;s house by five other widows, and in this case
they halt at a stream by the way and the bangles and beads are broken
from off her neck and wrists. On account, perhaps, of the utility of
their wives, and the social temptations which beset them from being
continually abroad at work, the Kohlis are lenient to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb497" href="#pb497" name=
"pb497">497</a>]</span>conjugal offences, and a woman going wrong even
with an outsider will be taken back by her husband and only a trifling
punishment imposed by the caste. A Kohli can also keep a woman of any
other caste, except of those regarded as impure, without incurring any
censure. Divorce is very seldom resorted to and involves severe
penalties to both parties. As among the Panw&#257;rs, a wife retains
any property she may bring to her husband and her wedding gifts at her
own disposal, this separate portion being known as <i>khamora</i>. The
caste burn their dead when they can afford it, placing the head of the
corpse to the north on the pyre. The bodies of those who have died from
cholera or smallpox are buried. Like the Panw&#257;rs it is the custom
of the Kohlis on bathing after a funeral to have a meal of cakes and
sugar on the river-bank, a practice which is looked down on by orthodox
Hindus. After a month or so the deceased person is considered to be
united to the ancestors, and when he was the head of the family his
successor is inducted to the position by the presentation of a new
head-cloth and a silver bangle. The bereaved family are then formally
escorted to the weekly market and are considered to have resumed their
regular social relations. The Kohlis revere the ordinary Hindu deities,
and on the day of Dasahra they worship their axe, sickle and
ploughshare by washing them and making an offering of rice, flowers and
turmeric. The axe is no doubt included because it serves to cut the
wood for fencing the sugarcane garden.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. The Kohlis as tank-builders.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kohlis were the builders of the great tanks of the
Bhand&#257;ra District. The most important of these are Nawegaon with
an area of five square miles and a circumference of seventeen, and
Seoni, over seven miles round, while smaller tanks are counted by
thousands. Though the largest are the work of the Kohlis, many of the
others have been constructed by the Panw&#257;rs of this tract, who
have also much aptitude for irrigation. Built as they were without
technical engineering knowledge, the tanks form an enduring monument to
the native ability and industry of these enterprising cultivators.
&ldquo;Working,&rdquo; Mr. Danks remarks,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16092src" href="#xd21e16092" name="xd21e16092src">4</a>
&ldquo;without instruments, unable even to take a level, finding out
their mistakes by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb498" href=
"#pb498" name="pb498">498</a>]</span>destruction of the works they had
built, ever repairing, reconstructing, altering, they have raised in
every village a testimony to their wisdom, their industry and their
perseverance.&rdquo; Although Nawegaon tank has a water area of seven
square miles, the combined length of the two artificial embankments is
only 760 yards, and this demonstrates the great skill with which the
site has been selected. At some of the tanks men are stationed day and
night during the rainy season to see if the embankment is anywhere
weakened by the action of the water, and in that case to give the alarm
to the village by beating a drum. The Nawegaon tank is said to have
been built at the commencement of the eighteenth century by one Kolu
Patel Kohli. As might be expected, Kolu Patel has been deified as
Kol&#257;sur Deo, and his shrine is on one of the peaks surrounding the
tank. Seven other peaks are known as the S&#257;t Bahini or
&lsquo;Seven Sisters,&rsquo; and it is said that these deities assisted
Kolu in building the tank, by coming and working on the embankment at
night when the labourers had left. Some whitish-yellow stones on
Kol&#257;sur&rsquo;s hill are said to be the baskets of the Seven
Sisters in which they carried earth. &ldquo;The Kohli,&rdquo; Mr.
Napier states,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16099src" href="#xd21e16099"
name="xd21e16099src">5</a> &ldquo;sacrifices all to his sugarcane, his
one ambition and his one extravagance being to build a large reservoir
which will contain water for the irrigation of his sugarcane during the
long, hot months.&rdquo; Each rates the other according to the size of
his tank and the strength of its embankment. Under the Gond kings a man
who built a tank received a grant of the fields lying below it either
free of revenue or on a very light assessment. Such grants were known
as Tukm, and were probably a considerable incentive to tank-building.
Unfortunately sugarcane, formerly a most profitable crop, has been
undersold by the canal- and tank-irrigated product of northern India,
and at present scarcely repays cultivation.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">4. Agricultural customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kohli villages are managed on a somewhat
patriarchal system, and the dealings between proprietors and
cultivators are regulated by their own custom without much regard to
the rules imposed by Government. Mr. Napier says of them:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16108src" href="#xd21e16108" name=
"xd21e16108src">6</a> &ldquo;The Kohlis are very good landlords as a
general rule; but in their dealings with their tenants and their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb499" href="#pb499" name=
"pb499">499</a>]</span>labourers follow their own customs, while the
provisions of the Tenancy Act often remain in abeyance. They admit no
tenant right in land capable of being irrigated for sugarcane, and
change the tenants as they please; and in many villages a large number
of the labourers are practically serfs, being fed, clothed and married
by their employers, for whom they and their children work all their
lives without any fixed wages. These customs are acquiesced in by all
parties, and, so far as I could learn, there was no discontent. They
have a splendid caste discipline, and their quarrels are settled
expeditiously by their <i>panch&#257;yats</i> or committees without
reference to courts of law.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="xd21e16117" class="div2 section"><span class=
"pagenum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. General characteristics.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In appearance and character the Kohlis cannot be said
to show much trace of distinction. The men wear a short white
<i>bandi</i> or coat, and a small head-cloth only three feet long. This
is often scarcely more than a handkerchief which tightly covers the
crown, and terminates in knots, inelegant and cheap. The women wear
glass bangles only on the left hand and brass or silver ones on the
right, no doubt because glass ornaments would interfere with their work
and get broken. Their cloth is drawn over the left shoulder instead of
the right, a custom which they share with Gonds, K&#257;pew&#257;rs and
Buruds. In appearance the caste are generally dirty. They are ignorant
themselves and do not care that their children should be educated.
Their custom of polygamy leads to family quarrels and excessive
subdivision of property; thus in one village, Ashti, the proprietary
right is divided into 192 shares. On this account they are seldom
well-to-do. Their countenances are of a somewhat inferior type and
generally dark in colour. In character they are peaceful and amenable,
and have the reputation of being very respectful to Government
officials, who as a consequence look on them with favour. &lsquo;Their
heart is good,&rsquo; a tahs&#299;ld&#257;r<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16125src" href="#xd21e16125" name="xd21e16125src">7</a> of the
Bhand&#257;ra District remarked. If a guest comes to a Kohli, the host
himself offers to wash his feet, and if the guest be a Br&#257;hman,
will insist on doing so. They eat flesh and fowls, but abstain from
liquor. In social status they are on a level with the M&#257;lis and a
little below the regular cultivating castes. <span class=

<h3 class="main">1. General notice. Strength of the Kols in India.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Kol</b>, <b>Munda</b>, <b>Ho</b>.&mdash;A great
tribe of Chota N&#257;gpur, which has given its name to the Kolarian
family of tribes and languages. A part of the District of
Singhbh&#363;m near Chaib&#257;sa is named the Kolh&#257;n as being the
special home of the Larka Kols, but they are distributed all over Chota
N&#257;gpur, whence they have spread to the United Provinces, Central
Provinces and Central India. It seems probable also that the Koli tribe
of Gujar&#257;t may be an offshoot of the Kols, who migrated there by
way of Central India. If <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb501" href=
"#pb501" name="pb501">501</a>]</span>the total of the Kols, Mundas and
Hos or Larka Kols be taken together they number about a million persons
in India. The real strength of the tribe is, however, much greater than
this. As shown in the article on that tribe, the Sant&#257;ls are a
branch of the Kols, who have broken off from the parent stock and been
given a separate designation by the Hindus. They numbered two millions
in 1911. The Bhumij (400,000) are also probably a section of the tribe.
Sir H. Risley<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16274src" href="#xd21e16274"
name="xd21e16274src">1</a> states that they are closely allied to if
not identical with the Mundas. In some localities they intermarry with
the Mundas and are known as Bhumij Munda.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16279src" href="#xd21e16279" name="xd21e16279src">2</a> If the
Kolis also be taken as an offshoot of the Kol tribe, a further addition
of nearly three millions is made to the tribes whose parentage can be
traced to this stock. There is little doubt also that other Kolarian
tribes, as the Kharias, Khairwars, Korwas and Korkus, whose tribal
languages closely approximate to Mund&#257;ri, were originally one with
the Mundas, but have been separated for so long a period that their
direct connection can no longer be proved. The disintegrating causes,
which have split up what was originally one into a number of distinct
tribes, are probably no more than distance and settlement in different
parts of the country, leading to cessation of intermarriage and social
intercourse. The tribes have then obtained some variation in the
original name or been given separate territorial or occupational
designations by the Hindus and their former identity has gradually been
forgotten.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Names of the tribe.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The word Kol is probably the Sant&#257;li
<i>h&#257;r</i>, a man. This word is used under various forms, such as
<i>har</i>, <i>h&#257;ra</i>, <i>ho</i> and <i>koro</i> by most Munda
tribes in order to denote themselves. The change of <i>r</i> to
<i>l</i> is familiar and does not give rise to any
difficulty.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16311src" href=
"#xd21e16311" name="xd21e16311src">3</a> The word Korku is simply a
corruption of Kodaku, young men, and there is every probability that
the Hindus, hearing the Kol tribe call themselves <i>hor</i> or
<i>horo</i>, may have corrupted the name to a form more familiar to
themselves. An alternative derivation from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb502" href="#pb502" name=
"pb502">502</a>]</span>Sanskrit word <i>kola</i>, a pig, is improbable.
But it is possible, as suggested by Sir G. Grierson, that after the
name had been given, its Sanskrit meaning of pig may have added zest to
its employment by the Hindus. The word Munda, Sir H. Risley states, is
the common term employed by the Kols for the headman of a village, and
has come into general use as an honorific title, as the Sant&#257;ls
call themselves M&#257;njhi, the Gonds Bhoi, and the Bhangis and other
sweepers Mehtar. Munda, like Mehtar, originally a title, has become a
popular alternative name for the caste. In Chota N&#257;gpur those Kols
who have partly adopted Hinduism and become to some degree civilised
are commonly known as Munda, while the name Ho or Larka Kol is reserved
for the branch of the tribe in Singhbh&#363;m who, as stated by Colonel
Dalton, &ldquo;From their jealous isolation for so many years, their
independence, their long occupation of one territory, and their
contempt for all other classes that come in contact with them,
especially the Hindus, probably furnish the best illustration, not of
the Mund&#257;ris in their present state, but of what, if left to
themselves and permanently located, they were likely to become. Even at
the present day the exclusiveness of the old Hos is remarkable. They
will not allow aliens to hold land near their villages; and indeed if
it were left to them no strangers would be permitted to settle in the
Kolh&#257;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is this branch of the tribe whose members have come several times
into contact with British troops, and on account of their bravery and
warlike disposition they are called the Larka or fighting Kols. The
Mundas on the other hand appear now to be a very mixed group. The list
of their subcastes given<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16330src" href=
"#xd21e16330" name="xd21e16330src">4</a> by Sir H. Risley includes the
Khang&#257;r, Kharia, Mahali, Oraon and Savar Mundas, all of which are
the names of separate tribes, now considered as distinct, though with
the exception of the Oraons they were perhaps originally offshoots of
the Kols or akin to them; while the Bhuinh&#257;r or landholders and
N&#257;gvansi or Mundas of the royal house are apparently the
aristocracy of the original tribe. It would appear possible from the
list of sub-tribes already given that the village headmen of other
tribes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb503" href="#pb503" name=
"pb503">503</a>]</span>having adopted the designation of Munda and
intermarried with other headmen so as to make a superior group, have in
some cases been admitted into the Munda tribe, which may enjoy a higher
rank than other tribes as the R&#257;ja of Chota N&#257;gpur belongs to
it; but it is also quite likely that these groups may have simply
arisen from the intermarriages of Mundas with other tribes, alliances
of this sort being common. The Kols of the Central Provinces probably
belong to the Munda tribe of Chota N&#257;gpur, and not to the Hos or
Larka Kols, as the latter would be less likely to emigrate. But quite a
separate set of subcastes is found here, which will be given later.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">3. Origin of the Kolarian tribes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Munda languages have been shown by Sir G. Grierson
to have originated from the same source as those spoken in the
Indo-Pacific islands and the Malay Peninsula. &ldquo;The Mundas, the
Mon-Khmer, the wild tribes of the Malay Peninsula and the Nicobarese
all use forms of speech which can be traced back to a common source
though they mutually differ widely from each other.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16342src" href="#xd21e16342" name=
"xd21e16342src">5</a> It would appear therefore that the Mundas, the
oldest known inhabitants of India, perhaps came originally from the
south-east, the islands of the Indian Archipelago and the Malay
Peninsula, unless India was their original home and these countries
were colonised from it.</p>
<p>Sir E. Gait states: &ldquo;Geologists tell us that the Indian
Peninsula was formerly cut off from the north of Asia by sea, while a
land connection existed on the one side with Madagascar and on the
other with the Malay Archipelago; and though there is nothing to show
that India was then inhabited we know that it was so in palaeolithic
times, when communication was probably still easier with the countries
to the north-east and south-west than with those beyond the
Himalayas.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16349src" href=
"#xd21e16349" name="xd21e16349src">6</a> In the south of India,
however, no traces of Munda languages remain at present, and it seems
therefore necessary to conclude that the Mundas of the Central
Provinces and Chota N&#257;gpur have been separated from the tribes of
Malaysia who speak cognate languages for an indefinitely long period,
or else that they did not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb504" href=
"#pb504" name="pb504">504</a>]</span>come through southern India to
these countries, but by way of Assam and Bengal or by sea through
Orissa. There is good reason to believe from the names of places and
from local tradition that the Munda tribes were once spread over
Bih&#257;r and parts of the Ganges valley; and if the Kolis are an
offshoot of the Kols, as is supposed, they also penetrated across
Central India to the sea in Gujar&#257;t and the hills of the Western
Gh&#257;ts. It is presumed that the advance of the Aryans or Hindus
drove the Mundas from the open country to the seclusion of the hills
and forests. The Munda and Dravidian languages are shown by Sir G.
Grierson to be distinct groups without any real connection.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. The Kolarians and Dravidians.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though the physical characteristics of the two sets of
tribes display no marked points of difference, it has been generally
held by ethnologists who know them that they represent two distinct
waves of immigration, and the absence of connection between their
languages bears out this view. It has always been supposed that the
Mundas were in the country of Chota N&#257;gpur and the Central
Provinces first, and that the Dravidians, the Gonds, Khonds and Oraons
came afterwards. The grounds for this view are the more advanced
culture of the Dravidians; the fact that where the two sets of tribes
are in contact those of the Munda group have been ousted from the more
open and fertile country, of which according to tradition they were
formerly in possession; and the practice of the Gonds and other
Dravidian tribes of employing the Baigas, Bhuiyas and other Munda
tribes for their village priests, which is an acknowledgment that the
latter as the earlier residents have a more familiar acquaintance with
the local deities, and can solicit their favour and protection with
more prospect of success. Such a belief is the more easily understood
when it is remembered that these deities are not infrequently either
the human ancestors of the earliest residents or the local animals and
plants from which they supposed themselves to be descended.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Date of the Dravidian immigration.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Dravidian languages, Gondi, Kurukh and Khond, are
of one family with Tamil, Telugu, Malay&#257;lam and Canarese, and
their home is the south of India. As stated<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16366src" href="#xd21e16366" name="xd21e16366src">7</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb505" href="#pb505" name=
"pb505">505</a>]</span>by Sir E. Gait, there is at present no evidence
to show that the Dravidians came to southern India from any other part
of the world, and for anything that is known to the contrary the
languages may have originated there. The existence of the small Brahui
tribe in Baluchist&#257;n, who speak a Dravidian language but have no
physical resemblance to other Dravidian races, cannot be satisfactorily
explained, but as he points out this is no reason for holding that the
whole body of speakers of Dravidian languages entered India from the
north-west, and, with the exception of this small group of Brahuis,
penetrated to the south of India and settled there without leaving any
traces of their passage.</p>
<p>The Dravidian languages occupy a large area in Madras, Mysore and
Hyder&#257;b&#257;d, and they extend north into the Central Provinces
and Chota N&#257;gpur, where they die out, practically not being found
west and north of this tract. As the languages are more highly
developed and the culture of their speakers is far more advanced in the
south, it is justifiable to suppose, pending evidence to the contrary,
that the south is their home and that they have spread thence as far
north as the Central Provinces. The Gonds and Oraons too have stories
to the effect that they came from the south. It has hitherto been
believed, at least in the Central Provinces, that both the Gonds and
Baigas have been settled in this territory for an indefinite period,
that is, from prior to any Aryan or Hindu immigration. Mr. H. A. Crump,
however, has questioned this assumption. He points out that the Baiga
tribe have entirely lost their own language and speak a dialect of
Chhatt&#299;sgarhi Hindi in Mandla, while half the Gonds still speak
Gondi. If the Baigas and Gonds were settled here together before the
arrival of any Hindus, how is it that the Baigas do not speak Gondi
instead of Hindi? A comparison of the caste and language tables of the
census of 1901 shows that several of the Munda tribes have entirely
lost their own language, among these being the Binjhw&#257;r, Baiga,
Bhaina, Bhuiya, Bhumij, Chero and Khairw&#257;r, and the Bh&#299;ls and
Kolis if these are held to be Munda tribes. None of these tribes have
adopted a Dravidian language, but all speak corrupt forms of the
current Aryan vernaculars derived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb506"
href="#pb506" name="pb506">506</a>]</span>from Sanskrit. The Mundas and
Hos themselves with the Kharias, Sant&#257;ls and Korkus retain Munda
languages. On the other hand a half of the Gonds, nearly all the Oraons
and three-fourths of the Khonds still preserve their own Dravidian
speech. It would therefore seem that the Munda tribes who speak Aryan
vernaculars must have been in close contact with Hindu peoples at the
time they lost their own language and not with Gonds or Oraons. In the
Central Provinces it is known that R&#257;jp&#363;t dynasties were
ruling in Jubbulpore from the sixth to the twelfth century, in Seoni
about the sixth century and in Bh&#257;ndak near Ch&#257;nda from an
early period as well as at Ratanpur in Chhatt&#299;sgarh. From about
the twelfth century these disappear and there is a blank till the
fourteenth century or later, when Gond kingdoms are found established
at Kherla in Bet&#363;l, at Deogarh in Chhindw&#257;ra, at
Garha-Mandla<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16378src" href="#xd21e16378"
name="xd21e16378src">8</a> including the Jubbulpore country, and at
Ch&#257;nda fourteen miles from Bh&#257;ndak. It seems clear then that
the Hindu dynasties were subverted by the Gonds after the Muhammadan
invasions of northern India had weakened or destroyed the central
powers of the Hindus and prevented any assistance being afforded to the
outlying settlements. But it seems <i>prima facie</i> more likely that
the Hindu kingdoms of the Central Provinces should have been destroyed
by an invasion of barbarians from without rather than by successful
risings of their own subjects once thoroughly subdued. The Haihaya
R&#257;jp&#363;t dynasty of Ratanpur was the only one which survived,
all the others being supplanted by Gond states. If then the Gond
incursion was subsequent to the establishment of the old Hindu
kingdoms, its probable date may be placed from the ninth to the
thirteenth centuries, the subjugation of the greater part of the
Province being no doubt a gradual affair. In favour of this it may be
noted that some recollection still exists of the settlement of the
Oraons in Chota N&#257;gpur being later than that of the Mundas, while
if it had taken place long before this time all tradition of it would
probably have been forgotten. In Chhindw&#257;ra the legend still
remains that the founder of the Deogarh Gond dynasty, J&#257;tba, slew
and supplanted the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb507" href="#pb507"
name="pb507">507</a>]</span>Gaoli kings Ransur and Ghansur, who were
previously ruling on the plateau. And the Bastar R&#257;j-Gond
R&#257;jas have a story that they came from Warangal in the south so
late as the fourteenth century, accompanied by the ancestors of some of
the existing Bastar tribes. Jadu Rai, the founder of the
Gond-R&#257;jp&#363;t dynasty of Garha-Mandla, is supposed to have
lived near the God&#257;vari. A large section of the Gonds of the
Central Provinces are known as R&#257;wanvansi or of the race of
R&#257;wan, the demon king of Ceylon, who was conquered by R&#257;ma.
The Oraons also claim to be descended from R&#257;wan.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16386src" href="#xd21e16386" name=
"xd21e16386src">9</a> This name and story must clearly have been given
to the tribes by the Hindus, and the explanation appears to be that the
Hindus considered the Dravidian Gonds and Oraons to have been the enemy
encountered in the Aryan expedition to southern India and Ceylon, which
is dimly recorded in the legend of R&#257;ma. On the other hand the
Bhuiyas, a Munda tribe, call themselves <i>P&#257;wan-ka-put</i> or
Children of the Wind, that is of the race of Hanum&#257;n, who was the
Son of the Wind; and this name would appear to show, as suggested by
Colonel Dalton, that the Munda tribes gave assistance to the Aryan
expedition and accompanied it, an alliance which has been preserved in
the tale of the exploits of Hanum&#257;n and his army of apes.
Similarly the name of the R&#257;mosi caste of Ber&#257;r is a
corruption of R&#257;mvansi or of the race of R&#257;ma; and the
R&#257;mosis appear to be an offshoot of the Bh&#299;ls or Kolis, both
of whom are not improbably Munda tribes. A Hindu writer compared the
Bh&#299;l auxiliaries in the camp of the famous Chalukya
R&#257;jp&#363;t king Sidhr&#257;j of Gujar&#257;t to Hanum&#257;n and
his apes, on account of their agility.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16395src" href="#xd21e16395" name="xd21e16395src">10</a> These
instances seem to be in favour of the idea that the Munda tribes
assisted the Aryans, and if this were the case it would appear to be a
legitimate inference that at the same period the Dravidian tribes were
still in southern India and not mixed up with the Munda tribes in the
Central Provinces and Chota N&#257;gpur as at present. Though the
evidence is perhaps not very strong, the hypothesis, as suggested by
Mr. Crump, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb508" href="#pb508" name=
"pb508">508</a>]</span>that the settlement of the Gonds in the Central
Provinces is comparatively recent and subsequent to the early
R&#257;jp&#363;t dynasties, is well worth putting forward.</p>

<p class="first">In the Central Provinces the Kols and Mundas numbered
85,000 persons in 1911. The name Kol is in general use except in the
Chota N&#257;gpur States, but it seems probable that the Kols who have
immigrated here really belong to the Munda tribe of Chota N&#257;gpur.
About 52,000 Kols, or nearly a third of the total number, reside in the
Jubbulpore District, and the remainder are scattered over all Districts

<h3 class="main">7. Legend of origin.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kol legend of origin is that Sing-Bonga or the Sun
created a boy and a girl and put them together in a cave to people the
world; but finding them to be too innocent to give hope of progeny he
instructed them in the art of making rice-beer, which inflames the
passions, and in course of time they had twelve sons and twelve
daughters. The divine origin ascribed by the Kols, in common with other
peoples, to their favourite liquor may be noticed. The children were
divided into pairs, and Sing-Bonga set before them various kinds of
food to choose for their sustenance before starting out into the world;
and the fate of their descendants depended on their choice. Thus the
first and second pairs took the flesh of bullocks and buffaloes, and
from them are descended the Kols and Bhumij; one pair took shell-fish
and became Bhuiyas, two pairs took pigs and were the ancestors of the
Sant&#257;ls, one pair took vegetables only and originated the
Br&#257;hman and R&#257;jp&#363;t castes, and other pairs took goats
and fish, from whom the various S&#363;dra castes are sprung. One pair
got nothing, and seeing this the Kol pair gave them of their
superfluity and the descendants of these became the Ghasias, who are
menials in Kol villages and supported by the cultivators. The Larka
Kols attribute their strength and fine physique to the fact that they
eat beef. When they first met English soldiers in the beginning of the
nineteenth century the Kols were quickly impressed by their wonderful
fighting powers, and finding that the English too ate the flesh of
bullocks, paid them the high compliment of assigning to them the same
pair of ancestors as themselves. The N&#257;gvansi R&#257;jas of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb509" href="#pb509" name=
"pb509">509</a>]</span>Chota N&#257;gpur say that their original
ancestor was a snake-god who assumed human form and married a
Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s daughter. But, like Lohengrin, the condition of
his remaining a man was that he should not disclose his origin, and
when he was finally brought to satisfy the incessant curiosity of his
wife, he reverted to his first shape, and she burned herself from
remorse. Their child was found by some wood-cutters lying in the forest
beneath a cobra&rsquo;s extended hood, and was brought up in their
family. He subsequently became king, and his seven elder brothers
attended him as banghy-bearers when he rode abroad. The Mundas are said
to be descended from the seven brothers, and their sign-manual is a
<i>kawar</i> or banghy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16417src" href=
"#xd21e16417" name="xd21e16417src">11</a> Hence the R&#257;jas of Chota
N&#257;gpur regard the Mundas as their elder brothers, and the
R&#257;nis veil their faces when they meet a Munda as to a
husband&rsquo;s elder brother. The probable explanation of the story is
that the Hos or Mundas, from whom the kings are sprung, were a separate
section of the tribe who subdued the older Mundas. In memory of their
progenitor the N&#257;gvansi R&#257;jas wear a turban folded to
resemble the coils of a snake with a projection over the brow for its
head.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16420src" href="#xd21e16420" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The subcastes of the Kols in the Central Provinces
differ entirely from those in Chota N&#257;gpur. Of the important
subcastes here the Rautia and Rautele take their name from R&#257;wat,
a prince, and appear to be a military or landholding group. In Chota
N&#257;gpur the Rautias are a separate caste, holding land. The Rautia
Kols practise hypergamy with the Rauteles, taking their daughters in
marriage but not giving daughters. They will eat with Rauteles at
wedding feasts only and not on any other occasion. The Th&#257;kuria,
from <i>th&#257;kur</i>, a lord, are said to be the progeny of
R&#257;jp&#363;t fathers and Kol mothers; and the Kagwaria to be named
from <i>kagw&#257;r</i>, an offering made to ancestors in the month of
Kunw&#257;r. The Des&#257;ha, from <i>desh</i>, native country, belong
principally to Rewah. In some localities Bharias, Savars and
Khairw&#257;rs are found who call themselves Kols and appear to be
included in the tribe. The Bharias may be an offshoot of the Bhar tribe
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb510" href="#pb510" name=
"pb510">510</a>]</span>northern India. It has already been seen that
several groups of other tribes have been amalgamated with the Mundas of
Chota N&#257;gpur, probably in a great measure from intermarriage, and
a similar fusion seems to have occurred in the Central Provinces.
Intermarriage between the different subtribes, though nominally
prohibited, not infrequently takes place, and a girl forming a
<i>liaison</i> with a man of another division may be married to him and
received into it. The Rautias, however, say that they forbid this
practice.</p>

<h3 class="main">9. Totemism.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Mandla Kols have a number of totemistic septs. The
Bargaiyan are really called after a village Bargaon, but they connect
their name with the <i>bar</i> or banyan tree, and revere it. At their
weddings a branch of this tree is laid on the roof of the
marriage-shed, and the wedding-cakes are cooked in a fire made of the
wood of the banyan tree and served to all the relations of the sept on
its leaves. At other times they will not pluck a leaf or a branch from
a banyan tree or even go beneath its shade. The Kathotia sept is named
after <i>kathota</i>, a bowl, but they revere the tiger. Bagheshwar
Deo, the tiger-god, resides on a little platform in their verandas.
They may not join in a tiger-beat nor sit up for a tiger over a kill.
In the latter case they think that the tiger would not come and would
be deprived of his food, and all the members of their family would get
ill. If a tiger takes one of their cattle, they think there has been
some neglect in their worship of him. They say that if one of them
meets a tiger in the forest he will fold his hands and say,
&lsquo;Mah&#257;r&#257;j, let me pass,&rsquo; and the tiger will then
get out of his way. If a tiger is killed within the limits of his
village a Kathotia Kol will throw away his earthen pots as in mourning
for a relative, have his head shaved and feed a few men of his sept.
The Katharia sept take their name from <i>kathri</i>, a mattress. A
member of this sept must never have a mattress in his house nor wear
clothes sewn in crosspieces as mattresses are sewn. The word
<i>kathri</i> should never be mentioned before him as he thinks some
great misfortune would thereby happen to his family, but this belief is
falling into abeyance. The name of the Mudia or Mudrundia sept is said
to mean shaven head, but they apparently revere the white <i>kumhra</i>
or gourd, perhaps because it has some <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb511" href="#pb511" name="pb511">511</a>]</span>resemblance to a
shaven head. They give a white gourd to a woman on the third day after
she has borne a child, and her family then do not eat this vegetable
for three years. At the expiration of the period the head of the family
offers a chicken to Dulha Deo, frying it with the feathers left on the
head, and eating the head and feet himself. Women may not join in this
sacrifice. The Kumraya sept revere the brown <i>kumhra</i> or gourd.
They grow this vegetable on the thatch of their house-roof, and from
the time of planting it until the fruits have been plucked they do not
touch it. The Bhuwar sept are named after <i>bhu</i> or <i>bhumi</i>,
the earth. They must always sleep on the earth and not on cots. Other
septs are Nathunia, a nose-ring; Karpatia, a kind of grass; and
Binjhw&#257;r, from the tribe of that name. From Raigarh a separate
group of septs is reported, the names of which further demonstrate the
mixed nature of the tribe. Among these are Bandi, a slave; Kawar, Gond,
Dhanuh&#257;r, Birjhia, all of which are the names of distinct tribes;
Sonw&#257;ni, gold-water; Keri&#257;ri, or bridle; Kh&#363;nta, a peg;
and Kap&#257;t, a shutter.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage within the sept is prohibited, but violations
of this rule are not infrequent. Outside the sept a man may marry any
woman except the sisters of his mother or stepmother. Where, as in some
localities, the septs have been forgotten, marriage is forbidden
between those relatives to whom the sacramental cakes are distributed
at a wedding. Among the Mundas, before a father sets out to seek a
bride for his son, he invites three or four relatives, and at midnight
taking a bottle of liquor pours a little over the household god as a
libation and drinks the rest with them. They go to the girl&rsquo;s
village, and addressing her father say that they have come to hunt. He
asks them in what jungle they wish to hunt, and they name the
<i>sarna</i> or sacred grove in which the bones of his ancestors are
buried. If the girl&rsquo;s father is satisfied with the match, he then
agrees to it. A bride-price of Rs. 10&ndash;8 is paid in the Central
Provinces. Among the Hos of Chota N&#257;gpur so large a number of
cattle was formerly demanded in exchange for a bride that many girls
were never married. Afterwards it was reduced to ten head of cattle,
and it was decided that one pair of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb512" href="#pb512" name="pb512">512</a>]</span>bullocks, one cow and
seven rupees should be equivalent to ten head, while for poor families
Rs. 7 was to be the whole price.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16488src"
href="#xd21e16488" name="xd21e16488src">13</a> Among the Mundas of
Raigarh the price is three or four bullocks, but poor men may give Rs.
12 or Rs. 18 in substitution. Here weddings may only be held in the
three months of Aghan, M&#257;gh and Ph&#257;gun,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16491src" href="#xd21e16491" name="xd21e16491src">14</a> and
preferably in M&#257;gh. Their marriage ceremony is very simple, the
bridegroom simply smearing vermilion on the bride&rsquo;s forehead,
after which water is poured over the heads of the pair. Two pots of
liquor are placed beside them during the ceremony. It is also a good
marriage if a girl of her own accord goes and lives in a man&rsquo;s
house and he shows his acceptance by dabbing vermilion on her. But her
offspring are of inferior status to those of a regular marriage. The
Kols of Jubbulpore and Mandla have adopted the regular Hindu
ceremony.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Divorce and widow-marriage are permitted. In Raigarh
the widow is bound to marry her deceased husband&rsquo;s younger
brother, but not elsewhere. Among these Mundas, if divorce is effected
by mutual consent, the husband must give his wife a pair of loin-cloths
and provisions for six months. Polygamy is seldom practised, as women
can earn their own living, and if a wife is superseded she will often
run away home or set up in a house by herself. In Mandla a divorce can
be obtained by either party, the person in fault having to pay a fee of
Rs. 1&ndash;4 to the <i>panch&#257;yat</i>; the woman then breaks her
bangles and the divorce is complete.</p>

ineffective deity who concerns himself but little with human affairs.
But he may be invoked to avert sickness or calamity, and to this end
sacrifices of white goats or white cocks are offered to him. Next to
him comes Marang Buru, the mountain god, who resides on the summit of
the most prominent hill in the neighbourhood. Animals are sacrificed to
him here, and the heads left and appropriated by the priest. He
controls the rainfall, and is appealed to in time of drought and when
epidemic sickness is abroad. Other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb513"

tanks, wells and springs, and it is believed that when offended they
cause people who bathe in the water to be attacked by leprosy and skin
diseases. Even the low swampy rice-fields are haunted by separate
spirits. Desw&#257;li is the god of the village, and he lives with his
wife in the Sarna or sacred grove, a patch of the primeval forest left
intact to afford a refuge for the forest gods. Every village has its
own Desw&#257;li, who is held responsible for the crops, and receives
an offering of a buffalo at the agricultural festival. The Jubbulpore
Kols have entirely abandoned their tribal gods and now worship Hindu
deities. Devi is their favourite goddess, and they carry her iron
tridents about with them wherever they go. Twice in the year, when the
baskets of wheat or Gardens of Adonis are sown in the name of Devi, she
descends on some of her worshippers, and they become possessed and
pierce their cheeks with the trident, sometimes leaving it in the face
for hours, with one or two men standing beside to support it. When the
trident is taken out a quid of betel is given to the wounded man, and
the part is believed to heal up at once. These Kols also employ
Br&#257;hmans for their ceremonies. Before sowing their fields they

<h3 class="main">13. Witchcraft.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Among the Hos,&rdquo; Colonel Dalton states,
&ldquo;all disease in men or animals is attributed to one of two
causes&mdash;the wrath of some evil spirit who has to be appeased, or
the spell of some witch or sorcerer who should be destroyed or driven
out of the land. In the latter case a <i>sokha</i> or witch-finder is
employed to ascertain who has cast the spell, and various methods of
divination are resorted to. In former times the person denounced and
all his family were put to death in the belief that witches breed
witches and sorcerers. The taint is in the blood. When, during the
Mutiny, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb514" href="#pb514" name=
"pb514">514</a>]</span>Singhbh&#363;m District was left for a short
time without officers, a terrible raid was made against all who had
been suspected for years of dealing with the evil one, and the most
atrocious murders were committed. Young men were told off for the duty
by the elders; neither age nor sex were spared. When order was
restored, these crimes were brought to light, and the actual
perpetrators punished; and since then we have not only had no
recurrence of witch murders, but the superstition itself is dying out
in the Kolh&#257;n.&rdquo; Mr. H. C. Streatfeild states that among the
Mundas witches used to be hung head downwards from a p&#299;pal tree
over a slow fire, the whole village dancing as they were gradually
roasted, but whether this ceremony was purely vindictive or had any
other significance there is nothing to show.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">14. Funeral rites.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Hos of Chota N&#257;gpur were accustomed to place
large slabs of stone as tombstones over their graves, and a collection
of these massive gravestones indelibly marks the site of every Ho or
Mund&#257;ri village, being still found in parts of the country where
there have been no Kols for ages. In addition to this slab, a
megalithic monument is set up to the deceased in some conspicuous spot
outside the village; the pillars vary in height from five or six to
fifteen feet, and apparently fragments of rock of the most fantastic
shape are most favoured. All the clothes, ornaments and agricultural
implements of the dead man were buried with the body. The funeral rites
were of a somewhat touching character:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16547src" href="#xd21e16547" name="xd21e16547src">18</a>
&ldquo;When all is ready, a funeral party collects in front of the
deceased&rsquo;s house, three or four men with very deep-toned drums,
and a group of about eight young girls. The chief mourner comes forth,
carrying the bones exposed on a decorated tray, and behind him the
girls form two rows, carrying empty or broken pitchers or battered
brass vessels, while the men with drums bring up the rear. The
procession advances with a ghostly dancing movement, slow and solemn as
a minuet, in time to the beat of the deep-toned drums, not straight
forward, but mysteriously gliding&mdash;now right, now left, now
marking time, all in the same mournful cadence. In this manner the
remains are taken to the house of every friend and relative
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb515" href="#pb515" name=
"pb515">515</a>]</span>of the deceased within a circle of a few miles,
and to every house in the village. As the procession approaches each
house in the manner described, the inmates all come out, and the tray
having been placed on the ground at their door, they kneel over it and
mourn. The bones are also thus conveyed to all his favourite haunts,
the fields he cultivated, the grove he planted, the tank he excavated,
the threshing-floor where he worked with his people, the Akh&#257;ra or
dancing-arena where he made merry with them, and each spot which is
hallowed with reminiscences of the deceased draws forth fresh
tears.&rdquo; In Sambalpur<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16555src" href=
"#xd21e16555" name="xd21e16555src">19</a> the dead body of a Munda is
washed in wine before interment, and a mark of vermilion is made on the
forehead. The mourners drink wine sitting by the grave. They then
bathe, and catch a small fish and roast it on a fire, smearing their
hands with oil and warming them at the fire. It would appear that this
last rite is a purification of the hands after contact with the dead
body, but whether the fish is meant to represent the deceased and the
roasting of it is a substitute for the rite of cremation is not clear.
During the eight days of mourning the relatives abstain from
flesh-meat, but they eat fish. The Kols of Jubbulpore now bury or burn
the dead, and observe mourning exactly like ordinary Hindus.</p>

<h3 class="main">15. Inheritance.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Succession among the Mundas passes to sons only.
Failing these, the property goes to the father or brothers if any. At
partition the eldest son as a rule gets a slightly larger share than
the other sons, a piece of land, and in well-to-do families a yoke of
plough cattle, or only a bullock or a goat, and sometimes a bundle of
paddy weighing from 10 to 16 maunds.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16563src" href="#xd21e16563" name="xd21e16563src">20</a>
Partition cannot usually be made till the youngest son is of age.
Daughters get no share in the inheritance, and are allotted among the
sons just like live-stock. Thus if a man dies leaving three sons and
three daughters and thirty head of cattle, on a division each son would
get ten head of cattle and one sister; but should there be only one
sister, they wait till she marries and divide the bride-price. A father
may, however, in his lifetime make presents of cash or movables to a
daughter, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb516" href="#pb516" name=

rules still obtain among the Hinduised Kols.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Mundas,&rdquo; Colonel Dalton states,
&ldquo;are one of the finest of the aboriginal tribes. The men average
something like 5 feet 6 inches, and many of them are remarkably well
developed and muscular. Their skin is of the darkest brown, almost
black in many cases, and their features coarse, with broad flat noses,
low foreheads and thick lips, presenting as a rule a by no means
prepossessing appearance. The women are often more pleasing, the
coarseness of the features being less accentuated or less noticeable on
account of the extreme good-nature and happy carelessness that seldom
fail to mark their countenance. They are fond of ornament, and a group
of men and girls fully decked out for a festival makes a fine show.
Every ornament in the shape of bead necklace, silver collar, bracelet,
armlet and anklet would seem to have been brought out for the occasion.
The head-dress is the crowning point of the turn-out. The long black
hair is gathered up in a big coil, most often artificially enlarged,
the whole being fastened at the right-hand side of the back of the head
just on a level with and touching the right ear. In this knot are
fastened all sorts of ornaments of brass and silver, and surmounting
it, stuck in every available space, are gay plumes of feathers that nod
and wave bravely with the movements of the dance. The ears are
distorted almost beyond recognition by huge earrings that pierce the
lobe and smaller ones that ornament them all round.&rdquo; In Mandla
women are tattooed with the figure of a man or a man on horseback, and
on the legs behind also with the figure of a man. They are not tattooed
on the face. Men are never tattooed.</p>

times and seasons. The motion is slow and graceful, a monotonous
sing-song being kept up all through. The steps are in perfect time and
the action wonderfully even and regular. This is particularly
noticeable in some of the variations of the dances representing the
different seasons and the necessary acts of cultivation that each
brings with it. In one the dancers bending down make a motion with
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb517" href="#pb517" name=

keeping step with their feet all the time. Then come the reaping of the
crop and the binding of the sheaves, all done in perfect time and
rhythm, and making with the continuous droning of the voices a quaint
and picturesque performance.&rdquo; In the Central Provinces the Kols
now dance the Karma dance of the Gonds, but they dance it in more
lively fashion. The step consists simply in advancing or withdrawing
one foot and bringing the other up or back beside it. The men and women
stand opposite each other in two lines, holding hands, and the
musicians alternately face each line and advance and retreat with them.
Then the lines move round in a circle with the musicians in the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Munda boys are allowed to eat food cooked by other
castes, except the very lowest, until they are married, and girls until
they let their hair grow long, which is usually at the age of six or
seven. After this they do not take food as a tribe from any other
caste, even a Br&#257;hman, though some subtribes accept it from
certain castes as the Telis (oil-pressers) and Sundis or
liquor-vendors. In Jubbulpore the Kols take food from Kurmis,
Dh&#299;mars and Ah&#299;rs. The Mundas will eat almost all kinds of
flesh, including tigers and pigs, while in Raigarh they consider monkey
as a delicacy, hunting these animals with dogs. In the Central
Provinces they have generally abjured beef, in deference to Hindu
prejudice, and sometimes refuse field-mice, to which the Khonds and
Gonds are very partial. Neither Kols nor Mundas are, however,
considered impure and the barber and washerman will work for them. In
Sambalpur a woman is finally expelled from caste for a <i>liaison</i>
with one of the impure G&#257;ndas, Ghasias or Doms, and a man is
expelled for taking food from a woman of these castes, but adultery
with her may be expiated by a big feast. Other offences are much the
same as among the Hindus. A woman who gets her ear torn through where
it is pierced is put out of caste for six months or a year and has to
give two feasts on readmission.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Mandla the head of the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> is
known as Gaontia, a name for a village headman, and he is always of the
Bargaiya sept, the office being usually hereditary. When a serious
offence is committed the Gaontia fixes a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb518" href="#pb518" name="pb518">518</a>]</span>period of six months
to a year for the readmission of the culprit, or the latter begs for
reinstatement when he has obtained the materials for the penalty feast.
A feast for the whole Rautele subcaste will entail 500 seers or nearly
9 cwt. of kodon, costing perhaps Rs. 30, and they say there would not
be enough left for a cold breakfast for the offender&rsquo;s family in
the morning. When a man has a petition to make to the Gaontia, he folds
his turban round his neck, leaving the head bare, takes a piece of
grass in his mouth, and with four prominent elders to support him goes
to the Gaontia and falls at his feet. The others stand on one leg
behind him and the Gaontia asks them for their recommendation. Their
reverence for the caste <i>panch&#257;yat</i> is shown by their solemn
form of oath, &lsquo;Sing-Bonga on high and the Panch on
earth.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16607src" href="#xd21e16607"
name="xd21e16607src">21</a> The Kols of Jubbulpore and Mandla are now
completely conforming to Hindu usage and employ Br&#257;hmans for their
ceremonies. They are most anxious to be considered as good Hindus and
ape every high-caste custom they get hold of. On one occasion I was
being carried on a litter by Kol coolies and accompanied by a
R&#257;jp&#363;t chupr&#257;ssie and was talking to the Kols, who
eagerly proclaimed their rigid Hindu observances. Finally the
chupr&#257;ssie said that Br&#257;hmans and R&#257;jp&#363;ts must have
three separate brushes of date-palm fibre for their houses, one to
sweep the cook-room which is especially sacred, one for the rest of the
house, and one for the yard. Lying gallantly the Kols said that they
also kept three palm brushes for cleaning their houses, and when it was
pointed out that there were no date-palms within several miles of their
village, they said they sent periodical expeditions to the adjoining
District to bring back fibre for brushes.</p>

on the fruits and roots of the forests and the pursuit of game and
fish. Now, however, they have taken kindly to several kinds of labour.
They are much in request on the Assam tea-gardens owing to their good
physique and muscular power, and they make the best bearers of
<i>dhoolies</i> or palanquins. Kol bearers will carry a <i>dhoolie</i>
four miles an hour as against the best Gond pace of about three, and
they shake the occupant less. They also make excellent masons and
navvies, and are generally more honest workers than the other jungle
tribes. A Munda seldom comes into a criminal court.</p>

"xd21e16689src" href="#xd21e16689" name="xd21e16689src">1</a>&mdash;A
Dravidian tribe residing principally in the W&#363;n t&#257;luk of the
Yeotm&#257;l District. They number altogether about 25,000 persons, of
whom 23,000 belong to W&#363;n and the remainder to the adjoining
tracts of Wardha and Hyder&#257;b&#257;d. They are not found elsewhere.
The tribe are generally considered to be akin to the Gonds<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16695src" href="#xd21e16695" name=
"xd21e16695src">2</a> on the authority of Mr. Hislop. He wrote of them:
&ldquo;The Kol&#257;ms extend all along the Kandi Konda or Pindi Hills
on the south of the Wardha river and along the table-land stretching
east and north of M&#257;nikgad and thence south to D&#257;ntanpalli,
running parallel to the western bank of the Pr&#257;nh&#299;ta. The
Kol&#257;ms and the common Gonds do not intermarry, but they are
present at each other&rsquo;s nuptials and eat from each other&rsquo;s
hand. Their dress is similar, but the Kol&#257;m women wear fewer
ornaments, being generally content with a few black beads of glass
round their neck. Among their deities, which are the usual objects of
Gond adoration, Bh&#299;msen is chiefly honoured.&rdquo; Mr. Hislop
was, however, not always of this opinion, because he first excluded the
Kol&#257;ms from the Gond tribes and afterwards included them.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e16700src" href="#xd21e16700" name=
"xd21e16700src">3</a> In Wardha they are usually distinguished from the
Gonds. They have a language of their own, called after them
Kol&#257;mi. Sir G. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb521" href="#pb521"
name="pb521">521</a>]</span>Grierson<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16707src" href="#xd21e16707" name="xd21e16707src">4</a> describes
it as, &ldquo;A minor dialect of Ber&#257;r and the Central Provinces
which occupies a position like that of Gondi between Canarese, Tamil
and Telugu. The so-called Kol&#257;mi, the Bh&#299;li spoken in the
Pusad t&#257;luk of B&#257;sim and the so-called Naiki of Ch&#257;nda
agree in so many particulars that they can almost be considered as one
and the same dialect. They are closely related to Gondi. The points in
which they differ from that language are, however, of sufficient
importance to make it necessary to separate them from that form of
speech. The Kol&#257;mi dialect differs widely from the language of the
neighbouring Gonds. In some points it agrees with Telugu, in other
characteristics with Canarese and connected forms of speech. There are
also some interesting points of analogy with the Tod&#257; dialect of
the N&#299;lgiris, and the Kol&#257;ms must, from a philological point
of view, be considered as the remnants of an old Dravidian tribe who
have not been involved in the development of the principal Dravidian
languages, or of a tribe who have not originally spoken a Dravidian
form of speech.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e16716width" id="plate93"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">Group of K&#333;lams</p>
</div>
<p>The family names of the tribe also are not Gondi, but resemble those
of Mar&#257;tha castes. Out of fifty sept names recorded, only one,
Tek&#257;m, is found among the Gonds. &ldquo;All their songs and
ballads,&rdquo; Colonel Mackenzie says, &ldquo;are borrowed from the
Mar&#257;thas: even their women when grinding corn sing Mar&#257;thi
songs.&rdquo; In W&#363;n their dress and appearance resembles that of
the Kunbis, but in some respects they retain very primitive customs.
Colonel Mackenzie states that until recently in Ber&#257;r they had the
practice of capturing husbands for women who would otherwise have gone
unwedded, this being apparently a survival of the matriarchate. It does
not appear that the husbands so captured were ever unphilosophical
enough to rebel under the old regime, though British enlightenment has
taught them otherwise. Widows and widowers were exempt from capture and
debarred from capturing. In view of the connection mentioned by Sir G.
Grierson between the Kol&#257;mi dialect and that of the Tod&#257;s of
the N&#299;lgiri hills who are a small remnant of an ancient tribe and
still practise polyandry, Mr. H&#299;ra L&#257;l suggests that the
Kol&#257;ms may be connected <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb522" href=
"#pb522" name="pb522">522</a>]</span>with the Kolas, a tribe akin to
the Tod&#257;s<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16724src" href="#xd21e16724"
name="xd21e16724src">5</a> and as low in the scale of civilisation, who
regard the Kolamallai hills as their original home.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e16729src" href="#xd21e16729" name="xd21e16729src">6</a> He
further notes that the name of the era by which the calendar is
reckoned on the Malabar coast is Kolamba. In view of Sir G.
Grierson&rsquo;s statement that the Kol&#257;mi dialect is the same as
that of the N&#257;ik Gonds of Ch&#257;nda it may be noted that the
headman of a Kol&#257;m village is known as N&#257;ik, and it is
possible that the Kol&#257;ms may be connected with the so-called
N&#257;ik Gonds.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kol&#257;ms have no subtribes, but are divided for
purposes of marriage into a number of exogamous groups. The names of
these are in the <span class="corr" id="xd21e16740" title=
"Source: M&#257;rathi">Mar&#257;thi</span> form, but the tribe do not
know their meaning. Marriage between members of the same group is
forbidden, and a man may not marry two sisters. Marriage is usually
adult, and neither a betrothal nor a marriage can be concluded in the
month of Poush (December), because in this month ancestors are
worshipped. Colonel Mackenzie states that marriages should be
celebrated on Wednesdays and Saturdays at sundown, and Monday is
considered a peculiarly inauspicious day. If a betrothal, once
contracted, is broken, a fine of five or ten rupees must be paid to the
caste-fellows together with a quantity of liquor. Formerly, as stated
above, the tribe sometimes captured husbands, and they still have a
curious method of seizing a wife when the father cannot procure a mate
for his son. The latter attended by his comrades resorts to the jungle
where his wife-elect is working in company with her female relations
and friends. It is a custom of the tribe that the sexes should, as a
rule, work in separate parties. On catching sight of her the bridegroom
pursues her, and unless he touches her hand before she gets back to her
village, his friends will afford him no assistance. If he can lay hold
of the girl a struggle ensues between the two parties for her
possession, the girl being sometimes only protected by women, while on
other occasions her male relatives hear of the fray and come to her
assistance. In the latter case a fight ensues with sticks, in which,
however, no combatant may hit another on the head. If the girl is
captured the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb523" href="#pb523" name=
"pb523">523</a>]</span>marriage is subsequently performed, and even if
she is rescued the matter is often arranged by the payment of a few
rupees to the girl&rsquo;s father. Nowadays the whole affair tends to
degenerate into a pretence and is often arranged beforehand by the
parties. The marriage ceremony resembles that of the Kunbis except that
the bridegroom takes the bride on his lap and their clothes are tied
together in two places. After the ceremony each of the guests takes a
few grains of rice, and after touching the feet, knees and shoulders of
the bridal couple with the rice, throws it over his own back. The idea
may be to remove any contagion of misfortune or evil spirits who may be
hovering about them. A widow can remarry only with her parents&rsquo;
consent, but if she takes a fancy to a man and chooses to enter his
house with a pot of water on her head he cannot turn her out. A man
cannot marry a widow unless he has been regularly wedded once to a
girl, and once having espoused a widow by what is known as the
<i>p&#257;t</i> ceremony, he cannot again go through a proper marriage.
A couple who wish to be divorced must go before the caste
<i>panch&#257;yat</i> or committee with a pot of liquor. Over this is
laid a dry stick and the couple each hold an end of it. The husband
then addresses his wife as sister in the presence of the caste-fellows,
and the wife her husband as brother; they break the stick and the
divorce is complete.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Disposal of the dead.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tribe bury their dead, and observe mourning for
one to five days in different localities. The spirits of deceased
ancestors are worshipped on any Monday in the month of Poush. The
mourner goes and dips his head into a tank or stream, and afterwards
sacrifices a fowl on the bank, and gives a meal to the caste-fellows.
He then has the hair of his face and head shaved. Sons inherit equally,
and if there are no sons the property devolves on daughters.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Religion and superstitions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kol&#257;ms, Colonel Mackenzie states, recognise
no god as a principle of beneficence in the world; their principal
deities are S&#299;ta, to whom the first-fruits of the harvest are
offered, and Devi who is the guardian of the village, and is
propitiated with offerings of goats and fowls to preserve it from harm.
She is represented by two stones set up in the centre of the village
when it is founded. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb524" href=
"#pb524" name="pb524">524</a>]</span>worship their implements of
agriculture on the last day of Chait (April), applying turmeric and
vermilion to them. In May they collect the stumps of ju&#257;ri from a
field, and, burning them to ashes, make an offering of the same
articles. They have a curious ceremony for protecting the village from
disease. All the men go outside the village and on the boundary at the
four points pointing north-east, north-west and opposite place four
stones known as <i>bandi</i>, burying a fowl beneath each stone. The
N&#257;ik or headman then sacrifices a goat and other fowls to
S&#299;ta, and placing four men by the stones, proceeds to sprinkle
salt all along the boundary line, except across one path on which he
lays his stick. He then calls out to the men that the village is closed
and that they must enter it only by that path. This rule remains in
force throughout the year, and if any stranger enters the village by
any other than the appointed route, they consider that he should pay
the expenses of drawing the boundary circuit again. But the rule is
often applied only to carts, and relaxed in favour of travellers on
foot. The line marked with salt is called <i>bandesh</i>, and it is
believed that wild animals cannot cross it, while they are prevented
from coming into the village along the only open road by the stick of
the N&#257;ik. Diseases also cannot cross the line. Women during their
monthly impurity are made to live in a hut in the fields outside the
boundary line. The open road does not lead across the village, but
terminates at the <i>chauri</i> or meeting-house.</p>

<h3 class="main">5. Social position.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though the Kol&#257;ms retain some very primitive
customs, those of Yeotm&#257;l, as already stated, are hardly
distinguishable from the Kunbis or Hindu cultivators. Colonel Mackenzie
notes that they are held to be lower than the Gonds, because a
Kol&#257;m will take food from a Gond, but the latter will not return
the compliment. They will eat the flesh of rats, tigers, snakes,
squirrels and of almost any animals except dogs, donkeys and jackals.
In another respect they are on a level with the lowest aborigines, as
some of them do not use water to clean their bodies after performing
natural functions, but only leaves. Yet they are not considered as
impure by the Hindus, are permitted <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb525" href="#pb525" name="pb525">525</a>]</span>to enter Hindu
temples, and hold themselves to be defiled by the touch of a Mah&#257;r
or a M&#257;ng. A Kol&#257;m is forbidden to beg by the rules of the
tribe, and he looks down on the Mah&#257;rs and M&#257;ngs, who are
often professional beggars. In Wardha, too, the Kol&#257;ms will not
collect dead-wood for sale as fuel.</p>

<h3 class="main">6. Miscellaneous customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Here their houses contain only a single room with a
small store-house, and all the family sleep together without privacy.
Consequently there is no opportunity at night for conjugal intimacy,
and husband and wife seek the solitude of the forest in the daytime.
Colonel Mackenzie states: &ldquo;All Kol&#257;ms are great smokers, but
they are not allowed to smoke in their own houses, but only at the
<i>chauri</i> or meeting-house, where pipes and fire are kept; and this
rule is enforced so that the N&#257;ik or headman can keep an eye on
all male members of the community; if these do not appear at least once
a day, satisfactory reasons are demanded for their absence, and from
this rule only the sick and infirm are exempt. The Kol&#257;ms have two
musical instruments: the <i>t&#257;pate</i> or drum, and the
<i>w&#257;ss</i> or flute, the name of which is probably derived from
the Sanskrit <i>w&#257;unsh</i>, meaning bamboo (of which the
instrument is made). In old times all Kol&#257;ms could read and write,
and it is probably only poverty which prevents them from having all
their children educated now.&rdquo; This last statement must, however,
be accepted with reserve in the absence of intimation of the evidence
on which it is based. At present they are, as a rule, quite illiterate.
The N&#257;ik or headman formerly had considerable powers, being
entrusted with the distribution of land among the cultivators, and
exercising civil and criminal jurisdiction with the assistance of the
<i>panch&#257;yat</i>. His own land was ploughed for him by the
villagers. Even now they seldom enter a court of justice and their
disputes are settled by the <i>panch&#257;yat</i>. A strong feeling of
clannishness exists among them, and the village unites to avenge an
injury done to one of its members. Excommunication from caste is
imposed for the usual offences, and the ceremony of readmission is as
follows: The offender dips his head in a river or stream and the
village barber shaves his head and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb526"
href="#pb526" name="pb526">526</a>]</span>moustaches. He then sits
beside a lighted pile of wood, being held to be purified by the
proximity of the holy element, and afterwards bathes, and drinks some
water into which the caste-fellows have dipped their toes. A woman has
to undergo the same ceremony and have her head shaved. If an unmarried
girl becomes with child by a member of the caste, she is married to him
by the simple rite used for widow-remarriage. A Kol&#257;m must not
swear by a dog or cat, and is expelled from caste for killing either of
these two animals. A Kol&#257;m does not visit a friend&rsquo;s house
in the evening, as he would be suspected in such an event of having
designs upon his wife&rsquo;s virtue. The tribe are cultivators and
labourers. They have not a very good reputation for honesty, and are
said to be addicted to stealing the ripe cotton from the bolls. They
never wear shoes, and the soles of their feet become nearly
invulnerable and capable of traversing the most thorny ground without
injury. They have an excellent knowledge of the medicinal and other
uses of all trees, shrubs and herbs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

name by which the Beria caste of Northern and Central India is known in
Ber&#257;r. The Berias themselves, in Central India at any rate, are a
branch of the S&#257;nsias, a vagrant and criminal class, whose
traditional occupation was that of acting as bards and genealogists to
the J&#257;t caste. The main difference between the S&#257;nsias and
Berias is that the latter prostitute their women, or those of them who
are not married.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16875src" href=
"#xd21e16875" name="xd21e16875src">2</a> The Kolh&#257;tis of
Ber&#257;r, who also do this, appear to be a branch of the Beria caste
who have settled in the Deccan and now have customs differing in
several respects from those of the parent caste. It is therefore
desirable to reproduce briefly the main heads of the information given
about them in the works cited above. In 1901 the Kolh&#257;tis numbered
1300 persons in Ber&#257;r. In the Central Provinces they were not
shown separately, but were included with the Nats. But in 1891 a total
of 250 Kolh&#257;tis were returned. The word Kolh&#257;ti is said to be
derived from the long bamboo poles which they use for jumping, known as
Kolh&#257;t. The other names, Dandew&#257;la and B&#257;nsberia,
meaning those who perform feats with a stick or bamboo, also have
reference to this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb528" href="#pb528"
name="pb528">528</a>]</span>pole. Kab&#363;tari as applied to the women
signifies that their dancing resembles the flight of a pigeon
(<i>kab&#363;tar</i>). They say that once on a time a demon had
captured some Kunbis and shut them up in a cavern. But the Kunbis
besought Mah&#257;deo to save them, and he created a man and a woman
who danced before the demon and so pleased him that he promised them
whatever they should ask; and they thus obtained the freedom of the
Kunbis. The man and woman were named Kab&#363;tar and Kab&#363;tari on
account of their skilful dancing, and were the ancestors of the
Kolh&#257;tis. The Kolh&#257;tis of the Central Provinces appear to
differ in several respects from those of Ber&#257;r, with whom the
following article is mainly concerned.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Internal structure.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste has two main divisions in Ber&#257;r, the
Dukar Kolh&#257;tis and the Kh&#257;m or P&#257;l Kolh&#257;tis. The
name of the former is derived from <i>dukar</i>, hog, because they are
accustomed to hunt the wild pig with dogs and spears when these animals
become too numerous and damage the crops of the villagers. They also
labour for themselves by cultivating land and taking service as village
watchmen; and they are daring criminals and commit dacoity, burglary
and theft; but they do not steal cattle. The Kh&#257;m Kolh&#257;tis,
on the other hand, are a lazy, good-for-nothing class of men, who,
beyond making a few combs and shuttles of bone, will set their hands to
no kind of labour, but subsist mainly by the immoral pursuits of their
women. At every large fair may be seen some of the portable huts of
this tribe, made of <i>rusa</i> grass,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e16895src" href="#xd21e16895" name="xd21e16895src">3</a> the women
decked in jewels and gaudy attire sitting at each door, while the men
are lounging lazily at the back. The Dukar Kolh&#257;ti women, Mr.
Kitts states, also resort to the same mode of life, but take up their
abode in villages instead of attending fairs. Among the Dukar
Kolh&#257;tis the subdivisions have R&#257;jp&#363;t names; and just as
a Chauh&#257;n R&#257;jp&#363;t may not marry another Chauh&#257;n so
also a Chauh&#257;n Dukar Kolh&#257;ti may not marry a person of his
own clan. In Bil&#257;spur they are said to have four subcastes, the
Marethi or those coming from the Mar&#257;tha country, the
B&#257;nsberia or pole-jumpers, the Suarw&#257;le or hunters of the
wild pig, and the Muhammadan Kolh&#257;tis, none of whom <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb529" href="#pb529" name=
"pb529">529</a>]</span>marry or take food with each other. Each group
is further subdivided into the Asal and Kamsal (<i>Kam-asal</i>), or
the pure and mixed Kolh&#257;tis, who marry among themselves, outsiders
being admitted to the Kamsal or mixed group.</p>

<p class="first">The marriage ceremony in Ber&#257;r<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e16909src" href="#xd21e16909" name="xd21e16909src">4</a>
consists simply in a feast at which the bride and bridegroom, dressed
in new clothes, preside. Much liquor is consumed and the dancing-girls
of the tribe dance before them, and the happy couple are considered
duly married according to Kolh&#257;ti rites. Married women do not
perform in public and are no less moral and faithful than those of
other castes, while those brought up as dancing-girls do not marry at
all. In Bil&#257;spur weddings are arranged through the headman of the
village, who receives a fee for his services, and the ceremony includes
some of the ordinary Hindu rites. Here a widow is compelled to marry
her late husband&rsquo;s younger brother on pain of exclusion from
caste. People of almost any caste may become Kolh&#257;tis. When an
outsider is admitted he must have a sponsor into whose clan he is
adopted. A feast is given to the caste, and the applicant catches the
right little finger of his sponsor before the assembly. Great numbers
of R&#257;jp&#363;ts and Muhammadans join them, and on the other hand a
large proportion of the fair but frail Kolh&#257;tis embrace the
Muhammadan faith.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16914src" href=

<h3 class="main">4. Funeral rites.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The bodies of children are buried, and those of the
adult dead may be either buried or cremated. Mr. Kitts states that on
the third day, if they can afford the ceremony, they bring back the
skull and placing it on a bed offer to it powder, dates and
betel-leaves; and after a feast lasting for three days it is again
buried. According to Major Gunthorpe the proceedings are more
elaborate: &ldquo;Each division of the caste has its own burial-ground
in some special spot, to which it is the heart&rsquo;s desire of every
Kolh&#257;ti to carry, when he can afford it, the bones of his deceased
relatives. After the cremation of an adult the bones are collected and
buried pending such time as they can be conveyed to the appointed
cemetery, if this be at a distance. When the time comes, that is, when
means can be found for the removal, the bones <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb530" href="#pb530" name="pb530">530</a>]</span>are
disinterred and placed in two saddle-bags on a donkey, the skull and
upper bones in the right bag and the leg and lower bones in the left.
The ass is then led to the deceased&rsquo;s house, where the bags of
bones are placed under a canopy made ready for their reception. High
festival, as for a marriage, is held for three days, and at the end of
this time the bags are replaced on the donkey, and with tom-toms
beating and dancing-girls of the tribe dancing in front, the animal is
led off to the cemetery. On arrival, the bags, with the bones in them,
are laid in a circular hole, and over it a stone is placed to mark the
spot, and covered with oil and vermilion; and the spirit of the
deceased is then considered to be appeased.&rdquo; They believe that
the spirits of dead ancestors enter the bodies of the living and work
evil to them, unless they are appeased with offerings. The Dukar
Kolh&#257;tis offer a boar to the spirits of male ancestors and a sow
to females. An offering of a boar is also made to Bhagw&#257;n
(Vishnu), who is the principal deity of the caste and is worshipped
with great ceremony every second year.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">5. Other customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although of low caste the Kolh&#257;tis refrain from
eating the flesh of the cow and other animals of the same tribe. The
wild cat, mongoose, wild and tame pig and jackal are considered as
delicacies. The caste have the same ordeals as are described in the
article on the S&#257;nsias. As might be expected in a class which
makes a living by immoral practices the women considerably outnumber
the men. No one is permanently expelled from caste, and temporary
exclusion is imposed only for a few offences, such as an intrigue with
or being touched by a member of an impure caste. The offender gives a
feast, and in the case of a man the moustache is shaved, while a woman
has five hairs of her head cut off. The women have names meant to
indicate their attractions, as Panna emerald, Munga coral, Meht&#257;b
dazzling, Gulti a flower, Moti a pearl, and Kesar saffron. If a girl is
detected in an intrigue with a caste-fellow they are fined seven rupees
and must give a feast to the caste, and are then married. When,
however, a girl is suspected of unchastity and no man will take the
responsibility on himself, she is put to an ordeal. She <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb531" href="#pb531" name=
"pb531">531</a>]</span>fasts all night, and next morning is dressed in
a white cloth, and water is poured over her head from a new earthen
pot. A piece of iron is heated red hot between cowdung cakes, and she
must take up this in her hand and walk five steps with it, also
applying it to the tip of her tongue. If she is burnt her unchastity is
considered to be proved, and the idea is therefore apparently that if
she is innocent the deity will intervene to save her.</p>

<h3 class="main">6. Occupation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Dukar Kolh&#257;ti males, Major Gunthorpe states,
are a fine manly set of fellows. They hunt the wild boar with dogs, the
men armed with spears following on foot. They show much pluck in
attacking the boar, and there is hardly a man of years who does not
bear scars received in fights with these animals. The villagers send
long distances for a gang to come and rid them of the wild pig, which
play havoc with the crops, and pay them in grain for doing so. But they
are also much addicted to crime, and when they have decided on a
dacoity or house-breaking they have a good drinking-bout and start off
with their dogs as if to hunt the boar. And if they are successful they
bury the spoil, and return with the body of a pig or a hare as evidence
of what they have been doing. Stolen property is either buried at some
distance from their homes or made over to the safe keeping of men with
whom the women of the caste may be living. Such men, who become
intimate with the Kolh&#257;tis through their women, are often headmen
of villages or hold other respectable positions, and are thus enabled
to escape suspicion. Boys who are to become acrobats are taught to jump
from early youth. The acrobats and dancing-girls go about to fairs and
other gatherings and make a platform on a cart, which serves as a stage
for their performances. The dancing-girl is assisted by her admirers,
who accompany her with music. Some of them are said now to have
obtained European instruments, as harmoniums or gramophones. They do
not give their performances on Thursdays and Mondays, which are
considered to be unlucky days. In Bombay they are said to make a
practice of kidnapping girls, preferably of high caste, whom they sell
or bring up as prostitutes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e16943src" href=

<p class="first"><b>Koli.</b>&mdash;A primitive tribe akin to the
Bh&#299;ls, who are residents of the western Satp&#363;ra hills. They
have the honorific title of N&#257;ik. They numbered 36,000 persons in
1911, nearly all of whom belong to Ber&#257;r, with the exception of
some 2000 odd, who live in the Nim&#257;r District. These have hitherto
been confused with the Kori caste. The Koris or weavers are also known
as Koli, but in Nim&#257;r they have the designation of Khang&#257;r
Koli to distinguish them from the tribe of the same name. The Kolis
proper are found in the Burh&#257;npur tahs&#299;l, where most villages
are said to possess one or two families, and on the southern
Satp&#363;ra hills adjoining Ber&#257;r. They are usually village
servants, their duties being to wait on Government officers, cleaning
their cooking-vessels and collecting carts and provisions. The duties
of village watchman or <i>kotw&#257;r</i> were formerly divided between
two officials, and while the Koli did the most respectable part of the
work, the Mah&#257;r or Bal&#257;hi carried baggage, <span class="corr"
id="xd21e17005" title="Source: went">sent</span> messages, and made the
prescribed reports to the police. In Ber&#257;r the Kolis acted for a
time as guardians of the hill passes. A chain of outposts or watch
towers ran along the Satp&#363;ra hills to the north of Ber&#257;r, and
these were held by Kolis and Bh&#299;ls, whose duties were to restrain
the predatory inroads of their own tribesmen, in the same manner as the
Khyber Rifles now guard the passes on the North-West Frontier. And
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb533" href="#pb533" name=
"pb533">533</a>]</span>again along the Ajanta hills to the south of the
Ber&#257;r valley a tribe of Kolis under their N&#257;iks had charge of
the <i>gh&#257;ts</i> or gates of the ridge, and acted as a kind of
local militia paid by assignments of land in the villages.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e17013src" href="#xd21e17013" name=
"xd21e17013src">1</a> In Nim&#257;r the Kolis, like the Bh&#299;ls,
made a trade of plunder and dacoity during the unsettled times of the
eighteenth century, and the phrase &lsquo;N&#257;hal, Bh&#299;l,
Koli&rsquo; is commonly used in old Mar&#257;thi documents to designate
the hill-robbers as a class. The priest of a Muhammadan tomb in
Burh&#257;npur still exhibits an imperial Parw&#257;na or intimation
from Delhi announcing the dispatch of a force for the suppression of
the Kolis, dated <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1637. In the Bombay
Presidency, so late as 1804, Colonel Walker wrote: &ldquo;Most Kolis
are thieves by profession, and embrace every opportunity of plundering
either public or private property.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e17023src" href="#xd21e17023" name="xd21e17023src">2</a> The tribe
are important in Bombay, where their numbers amount to more than
1&frac12; million. It is supposed that the common term
&lsquo;coolie&rsquo; is a corruption of Koli,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e17028src" href="#xd21e17028" name="xd21e17028src">3</a> because
the Kolis were usually employed as porters and carriers in western
India, as &lsquo;slave&rsquo; comes from Slav. The tribe have also
given their name to Col&#257;ba.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17034src"
href="#xd21e17034" name="xd21e17034src">4</a> Various derivations have
been given of the meaning of the word Koli,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e17039src" href="#xd21e17039" name="xd21e17039src">5</a> and
according to one account the Kolis and Mairs were originally the same
tribe and came from Sind, while the Mairs were the same as the Meyds or
Mihiras who entered India in the fifth century as one of the branches
of the great White Hun horde. &ldquo;Again, since the settlement of the
Mairs in Gujar&#257;t,&rdquo; the writer of the <i>Gujar&#257;t
Gazetteer</i> continues, &ldquo;reverses of fortune, especially the
depression of the R&#257;jp&#363;ts under the yoke of the Muhammadans
in the fourteenth century, did much to draw close the bond between the
higher and middle grades of the warrior class. Then many
R&#257;jp&#363;ts sought shelter among the Kolis and married with them,
leaving descendants who still claim a R&#257;jp&#363;t descent and bear
the names of R&#257;jp&#363;t families. Apart from this, and probably
as the result of an original sameness of race, in some parts of
Gujar&#257;t and K&#257;thiaw&#257;r <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb534" href="#pb534" name="pb534">534</a>]</span>intermarriage goes on
between the daughters of Talabda Kolis and the sons of
R&#257;jp&#363;ts.&rdquo; Thus the Th&#257;kur of Talpuri Mahi
K&#257;ntha in Bombay calls himself a Pr&#257;mara Koli, and explains
the term by saying that his ancestor, who was a Pr&#257;mara or
Panw&#257;r R&#257;jp&#363;t, took water at a Koli&rsquo;s
house.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17050src" href="#xd21e17050" name=
"xd21e17050src">6</a> As regards the origin of the Kolis, however, whom
the author of the <i>Gujar&#257;t Gazetteer</i> derives from the White
Huns, stating them to be immigrants from Sind, another and perhaps more
probable theory is that they are simply a western outpost of the great
Kol or Munda tribe, to which the Korkus and N&#257;hals and perhaps the
Bh&#299;ls may also belong. Mr. H&#299;ra L&#257;l suggests that it is
a common custom in Mar&#257;thi to add or alter so as to make names end
in <i>i</i>. Thus Halbi for Halba, Koshti for Koshta, Patwi for Patwa,
Wanj&#257;ri for Banj&#257;ra, Gowari for Goala; and in the same manner
Koli from Kol. This supposition appears a very reasonable one, though
there is little direct evidence. The Nim&#257;r Kolis have no tradition
of their origin beyond the saying&mdash;</p>

between the two classes. A man must not marry a girl of his own sept
nor the daughter of his maternal uncle. Girls are usually married at an
early age. A Br&#257;hman is employed to conduct the marriage ceremony,
which takes place at sunset: a cloth is held between the couple, and as
the sun disappears it is removed and they join hands amid the clapping
of the assembled guests. Afterwards they march seven times round a
stone slab surrounded by four plough-yokes. Among the Rewa K&#257;ntha
Kolis the boy&rsquo;s father must not proceed on his journey to find a
bride for his son until on leaving his house he sees a small bird
called <i>devi</i> on his right hand; and consequently he is sometimes
kept waiting for weeks, or even for months. When the betrothal is
arranged the bridegroom and his father are invited to a feast at the
bride&rsquo;s house, and on leaving the father must stumble over the
threshold of the girl&rsquo;s door; without this omen no wedding can
prosper.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17113src" href="#xd21e17113" name=

important shrine of the goddess is situated in Ichh&#257;pur, ten or
twelve miles from Burh&#257;npur, and here members of the tribe were
accustomed to perform the hook-swinging rite in honour of the goddess.

<p class="first">The Kolis both bury and burn the dead, but the former
practice is more common. They place the body in the grave with head to
the south and face to the north. On the third day after the funeral
they perform the ceremony called <i>Kandhe kanchhna</i> or
&lsquo;rubbing the shoulder.&rsquo; The four bearers of the corpse come
to the house of the deceased and stand as if they were carrying the
bier. His widow smears a little <i>gh&#299;</i> (butter) on each
man&rsquo;s shoulder and rubs the place with a small cake which she
afterwards gives to him. The men go to a river or tank and throw the
cakes into it, afterwards bathing in the water. This ceremony is
clearly designed to sever the connection established by the contact of
the bier with their shoulders, which they imagine might otherwise
render them likely to require the use of a bier themselves. On the
eleventh day a Br&#257;hman is called in, who seats eleven friends of
the deceased in a row and applies sandal-paste to their foreheads. All
the women whose husbands are alive then have turmeric rubbed on their
foreheads, and a caste feast follows.</p>

href="#xd21e17175" name="xd21e17175src">1</a> <b>Kolita</b>,
<b>Kulta</b>.&mdash;An agricultural caste of the Sambalpur District and
the adjoining Uriya States. In 1901 the Central Provinces contained
127,000 Koltas out of 132,000 in India, but since the transfer of
Sambalpur the headquarters of the caste belong to Bih&#257;r and
Orissa, and only 36,000 remain in the Central Provinces. In Assam more
than two lakhs of persons were enumerated under the caste name of
Kalita in 1901, but in spite of the resemblance of the name the Kalitas
apparently have no connection with the Uriya country, while the Koltas
know nothing of a section of their caste in Assam. The Koltas of
Sambalpur say that they immigrated from Baud State, which they regard
as their ancestral home, and a member of their caste formerly held the
position of D&#299;wan of the State. According to one of their legends
their first ancestors were born from the leavings of food of the
legendary R&#257;ja Janak of Mithila or Tirh&#363;t, whose daughter
S&#299;ta married King R&#257;ma of Ajodhya, the hero of the
R&#257;m&#257;yana. Some Koltas went with S&#299;ta to Ajodhya and were
employed as water-bearers in the royal household. When R&#257;ma was
banished they accompanied him in his wanderings, and were permitted to
settle in the Uriya country at the request of the Raghunathia
Br&#257;hmans, who wanted cultivators to till the soil. Another legend
is that once upon a time, when R&#257;ma was wandering in the forests
of Sambalpur, he met three brothers and asked them to draw water for
him. The first <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb538" href="#pb538" name=
"pb538">538</a>]</span>brought water in a clean brass pot, and was
called Sudh (good-mannered). The second made a cup of leaves and drew
water from a well with a rope; he was called Dum&#257;l, from
<i>dori-m&#257;l</i>, a coil of rope. The third brought water only in a
hollow gourd, and he was named Kolta, from <i>ku-r&#299;ta</i>,
bad-mannered. This story serves to show that the Koltas, Sudhs and
Dum&#257;ls acknowledge some connection, and in the Sambalpur District
they will take food together at festivals. But this degree of intimacy
may simply have arisen from their common calling of agriculture, and
may be noticed among the cultivating castes elsewhere, as the
Kir&#257;rs, G&#363;jars and R&#257;ghuvansis in Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d.
The most probable theory of the origin of the Koltas is that they are
an offshoot of the great Chasa caste, the principal cultivating caste
of the Uriya country, corresponding to the Kurmis and Kunbis in
Hindust&#257;n and the Deccan. Several of their family names are
identical with those of the Chasas, and there is actually a subcaste of
Kolita Chasas. Mr. H&#299;ra L&#257;l conjectures that the Koltas may
be those Chasas who took to growing <i>kultha</i> (<i>Dolichos
uniflorus</i>), a favourite pulse in Sambalpur; just as the Santora
Kurmis are so named from their growing <i>san</i>-hemp, and the Alia
Banias and Kunbis from the <i>&#257;l</i> or Indian madder. This
hypothesis derives some support from the fact that the Koltas have no
subcastes, and the formation of the caste may therefore be supposed to
have occurred at a comparatively recent period.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Exogamous groups.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Koltas have both family names or <i>gotras</i> and
exogamous sections or <i>bargas</i>. The <i>gotras</i> are generally
named after animals or other objects, as D&#299;p (lamp), Bachh&#257;s
(calf), Hasti (elephant), Bh&#257;radw&#257;j (blue-jay), and so on.
Members of the Bachh&#257;s <i>gotra</i> must not yoke a young bullock
to the plough for the first time, but must get this done by somebody
else. The names of the <i>bargas</i> are generally derived from
villages or from offices or titles. In one or two cases they show the
admission of members of other castes; thus the R&#257;wat <i>barga</i>
are the descendants of a R&#257;wat (herdsman) who was in the service
of the R&#257;ja of Sambalpur. The R&#257;ja had brought him up from
infancy, and, wishing to make him a Kolta, married him to a Kolta
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb539" href="#pb539" name=
"pb539">539</a>]</span>girl, despite the protests of the caste. The
ancestor of the Hinmiya Bhoi <i>barga</i> had a mistress of the Khond
tribe, who left him some property, and is still worshipped in the
family. The number of <i>gotras</i> is smaller than that of the
<i>bargas</i>, and some <i>gotras</i>, as the N&#257;g or cobra, the
tortoise and the p&#299;pal tree, are common to many <i>bargas</i>.
Marriage is forbidden between members of the same <i>barga</i>, and
between first cousins on the father&rsquo;s side. To have the same
<i>gotra</i> is no bar to marriage.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Marriage</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Girls should be wedded before maturity, as among most
of the Uriya castes, and if no suitable husband is forthcoming a
nominal marriage is sometimes arranged with an old man, and the girl is
afterwards disposed of as a widow. The boy&rsquo;s father makes the
proposal for the marriage, and if this is accepted the following formal
ceremony takes place. He goes to the girl&rsquo;s village, accompanied
by some friends, and taking a quantity of <i>gur</i> (raw sugar), and
staying at some other house, sends a messenger known as Jalangia to the
girl&rsquo;s father, intimating that he has a request to make. The
girl&rsquo;s father pretends not to know what it is, and replies that
if he has anything to say the elders of the village should be called to
hear it. These assemble, and the girl&rsquo;s father informs them that
a stranger from another village has come to ask something of him, and
as he is ignorant of its purport, he has asked them to do him the
favour of being present. The boy&rsquo;s father then opens a parable,
saying that he was carried down a river in flood, and saved himself by
grasping a tree on the bank. The girl&rsquo;s father replies that the
roots of a riverside tree are weak, and he fears that the tree itself
would go down in the flood. The boy&rsquo;s father replies that in that
case he would be content to perish with the tree. Thereupon the caste
priest places a nut and some sacred rice cooked at
Jagann&#257;th&rsquo;s temple in the hands of the parties, who stand
together facing the company, and the girl&rsquo;s father says he has no
objection to giving his daughter in marriage, provided that she may not
be abandoned if she should subsequently become disfigured. The nut is
broken and distributed to all present in ratification of the agreement.
After this, other visits and a formal interchange of presents
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb540" href="#pb540" name=
"pb540">540</a>]</span>take place prior to the marriage proper. This is
performed with the customary ceremonial of the Uriya castes. The
marriage altar is made of earth brought from outside the village by
seven married women. Branches of the mahua tree are placed on the
altar, and after the conclusion of the ceremony are thrown into a tank.
The women also take a jar of water to a tank and, emptying it, fill the
jar with the tank water. They go round to seven houses, and at each
empty and refill the jar with water from the house. The water finally
brought back is used for bathing the bride and bridegroom, and is
believed to protect them from all supernatural dangers. An image of the
family totem made from powdered rice is anointed with oil and turmeric,
and worshipped daily while the marriage is in progress. If the boy or
girl is the eldest child, the parents go through a mock marriage
ceremony which the child is not allowed to see. When the couple are
brought into the marriage-shed, they throw seven handfuls of rice mixed
with <i>mung</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e17265src" href=
"#xd21e17265" name="xd21e17265src">2</a> and salt on each other. The
priest ties the hands of the couple with thread spun by virgins, and
the relatives then pour water over the knot. The bride&rsquo;s brother
comes up and unties the knot, and gives the bridegroom a blow on the
back. This is meant to show his anger at being deprived of his sister.
He is given a piece of cloth and goes away. Presents are made to the
pair, and the women throw rice on them. They are then taken inside the
house and set to gamble with cowries. If the bridegroom wins he
promises an ornament to the bride. If she wins she promises to serve
him. The boy then asks her to sit with him on a bench, and she at first
refuses, and agrees when he promises her other presents. Next day the
bride&rsquo;s mother singes the cheeks of the bridegroom with
betel-leaves heated over a lamp, and throws cowdung and rice over the
couple to protect them from evil. The party takes its departure for the
bridegroom&rsquo;s village, and on arrival there his sisters hold a
cloth over the door of the house and will not let the couple in till
they are given a present. The bridegroom then shoots an arrow at an
image of a monkey or a deer, made of powdered rice, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb541" href="#pb541" name="pb541">541</a>]</span>is
brought back, cooked and eaten. The bride goes home in a day or two,
and the Band&#257;pana ceremony is performed when she finally departs
to live with her husband on arrival at maturity. The Koltas allow
widow-marriage, but the husband has to pay a sum of about Rs. 100 to
the caste-people, the bulk of which is expended in feasting. Divorce
may be effected in the presence of the caste committee.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste worship the goddess R&#257;mchandi, whose
principal shrine is at Sarsara in Baud State. In order to establish a
local R&#257;mchandi, a handful of earth must be brought from her
shrine at Sarsara and made into a representation of the goddess. Some
consider that R&#257;mchandi is the personification of Mother Earth,
and the Koltas will not swear by the earth. They worship the plough in
the month of Shr&#257;wan, washing it with water and milk, and applying
sandal-paste with offerings of flowers and food. The Pu&#257;jiuntia
festival is observed in Kunw&#257;r for the well-being of a son. On
this occasion barren women try to ascertain whether they will get a
son. A hole is made in the ground and filled with water, and a living
fish is placed in it. The woman sits by the hole holding her cloth
spread out, and if the fish in struggling jumps into her cloth, it is
held to prognosticate the birth of a son. The caste worship their
family gods and totems on the 10th day of As&#257;rh, Bh&#257;don,
K&#257;rtik and M&#257;gh, which are called the pure months. They
employ Br&#257;hmans for religious ceremonies. Every man has a
<i>guru</i> who is a Bair&#257;gi, and he must be initiated by his
<i>guru</i> before he is allowed to marry. The caste both burn and bury
the dead. They eat flesh and fish, but generally abstain from liquor
and the flesh of unclean animals, though in some places they are known
to eat rats and crocodiles, and also the leavings of Br&#257;hmans.
Br&#257;hmans will take water from Koltas, and their social standing is
equal to that of the good agricultural castes.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Koltas are skilful cultivators and have the usual
characteristics belonging to the cultivating castes, of frugality,
industry, hunger for land, and readiness to resort to any degree of
litigation rather than relinquish a supposed right to it. They strongly
appreciate the advantages of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb542" href=
"#pb542" name="pb542">542</a>]</span>irrigation and show considerable
public spirit in constructing tanks which will benefit the lands of
their tenants as well as their own. Nevertheless they are not popular,
probably because they are generally more prosperous than their
neighbours. The rising of the Khonds of K&#257;l&#257;handi in 1882 was
caused by their discontent at being ousted from their lands by the
Koltas. The R&#257;ja of K&#257;l&#257;handi had imported a number of
Kolta cultivators, and these speedily got the Khond headmen and ryots
into their debt, and possessed themselves of all the best land in the
Khond villages. In May 1882 the Khonds rose and slaughtered more than
80 Koltas, while 300 more were besieged in the village of Norla, the
Khonds appearing with portions of the scalp and hair of the murdered
victims hanging to their bows. On the arrival of a body of police which
had been summoned from Vizagapatam, they dispersed, and the outbreak
was soon afterwards suppressed, seven of the ringleaders being
arrested, tried and hanged by the Political Officer. A settlement was
made of the grievances of the Khonds and tranquillity was restored.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Komti</b>, <b>Komati</b>.&mdash;The Madras caste of
traders corresponding to Banias. In 1911 they numbered 11,000 persons
in the Central Provinces, principally in the Ch&#257;nda and
Yeotm&#257;l Districts. The Komtis claim to be of the same status as
Banias and to belong to the Vaishya division of the Aryans, but this is
a very doubtful pretension. Mr. Francis remarks of them:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e17299src" href="#xd21e17299" name=
"xd21e17299src">1</a> &ldquo;Three points which show them to be of
Dravidian origin are their adherence to the custom of obliging a boy to
marry his paternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, however unattractive she may
be, a practice which is condemned by Manu; their use of the
Pur&#257;nic or lower ritual instead of the Vedic rites in their
ceremonies; and the fact that none of the 102 <i>gotras</i> into which
the caste is divided are those of the twice-born, while some at any
rate seem to be totemistic as they are the names of trees and plants,
and the members of each <i>gotra</i> abstain from touching or using the
plant or tree after which their <i>gotra</i> is called.&rdquo; They are
also of noticeably dark complexion. Komati is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb543" href="#pb543" name="pb543">543</a>]</span>said
to be a corruption of Gomati, a tender of cows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e17316src" href="#xd21e17316" name="xd21e17316src">2</a> The caste
have, however, a great reputation for cunning and astuteness, and hence
have arisen the popular derivations of <i>ko-mati</i>, fox-minded, and
<i>go-mati</i>, cow-minded. The real meaning of the word is obscure. In
Mysore the caste have the title of Setti or Chetty, which is a
corruption of the Sanskrit Sreshtha, good, and in the Central Provinces
their names often terminate with Appa.</p>
<p>The Komtis have the following story about themselves: Long ago, in
the Kaliyuga era, there lived a R&#257;jp&#363;t king of
R&#257;jahmundry, who on his travels saw a beautiful Vaishya girl and
fell in love with her. Her father refused him, saying that they were of
different castes. But the king persisted and would not be denied. On
which the maiden determined to sacrifice herself to save her honour,
and her clansmen resolved to die with her. So she told the king that
she would marry him if he would agree to the <i>hom</i> sacrifice being
performed at the ceremony. When the fire was kindled the girl threw
herself on it and perished, followed by a hundred and two of her
kinsmen. But the others were cowardly and fled from the fire. Before
she died the girl cursed the king and her caste-fellows who had fled,
and they and their families were cut off from the earth. But from those
who died the hundred and two clans of the Komtis are descended, and
they worship the maiden as Kanika Dev&#299;. She is considered to have
been an incarnation of P&#257;rvati and is the heroine of the
K&#257;nikya Pur&#257;n. It is also said that she ordained that
henceforth all Komtis should be black, so that none of their women
might come to harm by being desired for their beauty as she had been.
It is said that the caste look out for a specially dark girl as a
bride, and think that she will bring luck to her husband and cause him
to make money. Another explanation of their dark colour is that they
originally lived in Ceylon, and when the island was set on fire by
R&#257;ma their faces were blackened in the smoke. The hundred and two
clans have each a particular kind of flower or tree which they do not
grow, eat, touch or burn, and the explanation they give of this custom
is that their ancestors who went into the fire <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb544" href="#pb544" name="pb544">544</a>]</span>were
transformed into these trees and plants. The names of the plants
revered by each clan in the Central Provinces appear to be the same as
in Mysore. They include the brinjal, the mango, the cotton-plant,
wheat, linseed and others.</p>
<p>The caste have several subcastes, among which are the Yajna, or
those whose ancestors went into the fire; the Patti, who are apparently
thread-sellers; the Jaina, or those who follow the Jain faith; and the
Vid&#363;rs, a half-caste section, who are the offspring of a Yajna
father and a mother of some low caste. There is a scarcity of girls,
and a bride-price of Rs. 200 to Rs. 500 is often paid. Perhaps for the
same reason the obligation to give a daughter to a sister&rsquo;s son
is strictly enforced, and a man who refuses to do this is temporarily
put out of caste. The <i>gotras</i> of the mothers of the bride and
bridegroom should not be the same, and there should be no
&lsquo;Turning back of the creeper,&rsquo; as they say, that is, when a
girl has married into a family, the latter cannot give a girl in
marriage to that girl&rsquo;s family ever afterwards. Before the
regular betrothal when a girl has been selected, they appoint a day and
the bridegroom&rsquo;s party proceed outside the village to take the
omens. If a bad omen occurs, they give up the idea of the match and
choose another girl. When the bridegroom has arrived at the
bride&rsquo;s village, before the marriage takes place, he performs the
K&#257;shi-Y&#257;tra or Going to Ben&#257;res. He is dressed as for a
journey and carries a small handful of rice and other provisions tied
up in packages in his upper garment. Thus accoutred, he sets out with a
stick and umbrella on a pretended visit to Ben&#257;res, for the
purpose of devoting his life to study. The parents of the bride meet
him and beg him to give up the journey, promising him their daughter in
marriage.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17339src" href="#xd21e17339" name=
"xd21e17339src">3</a> The binding function of the marriage is the tying
of the <i>mangal-s&#363;tram</i> or piece of gold strung on a thread
round the bride&rsquo;s neck by the bridegroom. This gold piece is
called <i>pushti</i> and must never be taken off. If a woman loses it,
she should hide herself from everybody until it is replaced. On the way
to her husband&rsquo;s house, the bride should upset with her foot a
measure of rice kept <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb545" href="#pb545"
name="pb545">545</a>]</span>on purpose in the way, perhaps with the
idea of showing that there will be so much grain in her household that
she can afford to waste it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17353src" href=
"#xd21e17353" name="xd21e17353src">4</a> The Komtis did not eat in
kitchens in the famines, but accepted dry rations of food with great
reluctance. They wear the sacred thread and have caste-marks on their
foreheads. They usually rub powdered turmeric on their face and hands,
and this lends an unpleasant greenish tinge to the skin.</p>

<h3 class="main">1. Description of the caste.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Kori.</b>&mdash;The Hindu weaving caste of northern
India, as distinct from the Jul&#257;has or Momins who are Muhammadans.
In 1911 the Koris numbered 35,000 persons, and resided mainly in
Jubbulpore, Saugor and Damoh. Mr. Crooke states that their name has
been derived from that of the Kol caste, of whom they have by some been
assumed to be an offshoot.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17368src" href=
"#xd21e17368" name="xd21e17368src">1</a> The Koris themselves trace
their origin from Kab&#299;r, the apostle of the weaving castes. He,
they say, met a Br&#257;hman girl on the bank of a tank, and, being
saluted by her, replied, &lsquo;May God give you a son.&rsquo; She
objected that she was a virgin and unmarried, but Kab&#299;r answered
that his word could not fail; and a boy was born out of her hand, whom
she left on the bank of the tank. He was suckled by a heifer and
subsequently adopted by a weaver and was the ancestor of the Koris.
Therefore the caste say of themselves: &ldquo;He was born of an
undefiled vessel, and free from passion; he lowered his body and
entered the ocean of existence.&rdquo; This legend is a mere perversion
of the story of Kab&#299;r himself, designed to give the Koris a
distinguished pedigree. In the Central Provinces the caste appears to
be almost entirely a functional group, made up of members of other
castes who were either expelled from their own community or of their
own accord adopted the profession of weaving. The principal subdivision
is the Ahirw&#257;r, taking its name from the old town of Ahar in the
Bulandshahr District. Among the others are Kushta (Koshta),
Chad&#257;r, Katia, Mehra, Dh&#299;mar and Kotw&#257;r, all of which,
except the last, are the names of distinct castes; while the
Kotw&#257;rs represent members of the caste who became village
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb546" href="#pb546" name=
"pb546">546</a>]</span>watchmen, and considering themselves somewhat
superior to the others, have formed a separate subcaste. None of the
subcastes will eat together or intermarry, and this fact is in favour
of the supposition that they are distinct groups amalgamated into a
caste by their common profession of weaving. The caste seem to have a
fairly close connection with Cham&#257;rs in some localities. A number
of Koris belong to the sect of Rohid&#257;s, and some of their family
names are the same, while a Cham&#257;r will often call himself a Kori
to conceal his identity. For the purposes of marriage they are divided
into a number of <i>bainks</i> or septs, the names of which are
territorial or totemistic. Among the latter may be mentioned the
Kulhariya from <i>kulh&#257;ri</i>, an axe, and the Barmaiya from the
<i>bar</i> or banyan tree; members of these septs pay reverence to an
axe and a banyan tree respectively at weddings.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">2. Marriages</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The marriage of persons belonging to the same sept and
also that of first cousins is prohibited, while a family will not, if
they can help it, marry a daughter into the sept from which a son has
taken a wife. The rule of exogamy is thus rather wide in its action, as
is often found to be the case among the lowest and most primitive
castes. At the betrothal the father of the girl produces a red cloth
folded up, and on this the boy&rsquo;s father lays a rupee. This is
passed round to five members of the caste who cry,
&lsquo;So-and-so&rsquo;s daughter and So-and-so&rsquo;s son, <i>Har
bolo</i> (In the name of Vishnu).&rsquo; This completes the betrothal,
the father of the boy giving three rupees for a feast to the
caste-fellows. A girl who is made pregnant by a man of the caste or any
higher caste may be disposed of in marriage as a widow, but if the man
is of a lower caste than the Koris she is finally expelled. The
<i>lagan</i> or paper fixing the date of the marriage is written by a
Br&#257;hman and must not be shown to the bridegroom in the interval,
lest he should grow as thin as the paper bearing his name. While he is
being anointed and rubbed with turmeric the bridegroom is wrapped in a
black blanket, and his bridal dress consists of a yellow shirt, pyjamas
of red cloth, and red shoes, while he carries in his hand a dagger,
nut-cracker or knife. As he leaves his house to proceed to the
bride&rsquo;s village he steps on two clay lamp-saucers, crushing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb547" href="#pb547" name=
"pb547">547</a>]</span>them with his foot. When the party arrives the
fathers of the bride and bridegroom sit together with a pot full of
curds between them and give each other to drink from it as a mark of
amity. The binding portion of the marriage consists in walking round
the sacred pole and the other ceremonies customary in the northern
Districts are performed. The bride does not return with her husband
unless she is adult; otherwise the usual <i>gauna</i> ceremony is held
subsequently. When she arrives at her husband&rsquo;s house she makes
prints of her hands smeared with turmeric on the wall before entering
it for the first time. The remarriage of widows is freely permitted;
the second husband takes the widow to his house after sunset, and here
she is washed by the barber&rsquo;s wife and puts on glass bangles
again, and new jewellery and clothes, if any are provided. No married
woman may see her as she enters the house. The husband must give a
feast to the caste-fellows, or at least to the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> or
committee. Divorce is freely permitted on payment of a fine to the
<i>panch&#257;yat</i>. When a man takes a second wife a <i>sot</i> or
silver image of the deceased first wife is hung round her neck when she
enters his house, and is worshipped on ceremonial occasions.</p>

<h3 class="main">3. Customs at birth and death.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A child is named on the day after its birth by some
woman of the caste; a Br&#257;hman is asked whether the day is
auspicious, and he also chooses the name. If this is the same as that
of any living relation or one recently dead, another name is given for
ordinary use. A daughter-in-law is usually given a new name when she
goes to her husband&rsquo;s house, such as Badi (elder), Manjhli
(second son&rsquo;s wife), B&#257;ri (innocent or simple),
Jabalpurw&#257;li (belonging to Jubbulpore), and so on. If a woman has
borne only female children, the umbilical cord is sometimes put in a
small earthen pot and buried at a place where three cross-roads meet,
and it is supposed that the birth of a male child will follow. Children
whose shaving ceremony has not been performed, and adults dying from
snake-bite, cholera, smallpox or leprosy, are buried, while others are
burnt. Children are carried to the grave in their parents&rsquo; arms.
On the return of a funeral party, liquor, provided by the relatives of
the family, is drunk at the house of the deceased. <span class=

<h3 class="main">4. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Koris worship the ordinary Hindu deities and
especially Devi. They become inspired by this goddess at the Jawara
festival and pierce their cheeks with iron needles and tridents. Every
family has a household god or Kul-Deo to whom a small platform is
erected; offerings other than animal sacrifices are made to him on
festivals and on the celebration of a marriage.</p>

<div id="xd21e17422" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Occupation and social status.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Those of the caste who are Kab&#299;rpanthis abstain
from animal food, but the others eat the flesh of most animals except
tame pig, and also drink liquor. Their social status is very low, but
they are not usually considered as impure. Their women are tattooed on
the right arm before marriage, and on the left after arrival at their
husband&rsquo;s house. Like several other low castes, they do not wear
nose-rings. The principal occupation of the caste is the weaving of
coarse country cloth, but as the trade of the hand-weaver is nowadays
precarious and unprofitable many of them have forsaken it and taken to
cultivation or daily labour. Mr. Nesfield says of them: &ldquo;The
material used by the Kori is the thread supplied by the Dhunia (Bahna);
and thus the weaver caste has risen imperceptibly out of that of the
cotton-carder, in the same way as the cobbler caste has risen out of
the tanner. The art of weaving and plaiting threads is very much the
same process as that of plaiting osiers, reeds and grass, and
converting them into baskets and mats. This circumstance explains the
puzzle why the weaver caste in India stands at such a low social level.
He, however, ranks several degrees above the Cham&#257;r or tanner; as,
among Hindus, herbs and their products (cotton being of course
included) are invariably considered pure, while the hides of dead
animals are regarded as a pollution.&rdquo; This argument is part of
Mr. Nesfield&rsquo;s theory that the rank of each caste depends on the
period of civilisation at which its occupation came into being, which
is scarcely tenable. The reason why the weavers rank so low may,
perhaps, be that the Aryans when they settled in villages in northern
India despised all handicrafts as derogatory to their dignity. These
were left to the subject tribes, and as a large number of weavers would
be required, the industry would necessarily be embraced by the bulk of
those who formed the lowest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb549" href=
"#pb549" name="pb549">549</a>]</span>stratum of the population, and has
ever since remained in their hands. If cloth was first woven from the
tree-cotton plant growing wild, the business of picking and weaving it
would naturally have fallen to the non-Aryan jungle tribes, who
afterwards became the impure menial and labouring castes of the
villages.</p>
<p>The weaver is the proverbial butt of Hindu ridicule, like the tailor
in England. &lsquo;One Gadaria will account for ten weavers&rsquo;;
&lsquo;Four weavers will spoil any business.&rsquo; The following story
also illustrates their stupidity: Twenty weavers got into a field of
<i>k&#257;ns</i> grass. They thought it was a tank and began swimming.
When they got out they said, &ldquo;Let us all count and see how many
we are, in case anybody has been left in the tank.&rdquo; They counted
and each left out himself, so that they all made out nineteen. Just
then a Sow&#257;r came by, and they cried, to him, &lsquo;Oh, Sir, we
were twenty, and one of us has been drowned in this tank.&rsquo; The
Sow&#257;r seeing that there was only a field of grass, counted them
and found there were twenty; so he said, &lsquo;What will you give me
if I find the twentieth?&rsquo; They promised him a piece of cloth, on
which the Sow&#257;r, taking his whip, lashed each of the weavers
across the shoulders, counting as he did so. When he had counted twenty
he took the cloth and rode away. Another story is that a weaver bought
a buffalo for twenty rupees. His brother then came to him and wanted a
share in the buffalo. They did not know how he should be given a share
until at last the weaver said, &ldquo;You go and pay the man who sold
me the buffalo twenty rupees; and then you will have given as much as I
have and will be half-owner of the buffalo.&rdquo; Which was done. The
ridicule attaching to the weaver&rsquo;s occupation is due to its being
considered proper for a woman rather than a man, and similar jests were
current at the tailor&rsquo;s expense in England. In India the weaver
probably takes the tailor&rsquo;s place because woven and not sewn
clothes have hitherto been generally worn, as explained in the article
on Darzi. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb550" href="#pb550" name=

<p class="first"><b>Korku.</b><a class="noteref" id="xd21e17520src"
href="#xd21e17520" name="xd21e17520src">1</a>&mdash;A Munda or a
Kolarian tribe akin to the Korwas, with whom they have been identified
in the India Census of 1901. They number about 150,000 persons in the
Central Provinces and Ber&#257;r, and belong to the west of the
Satp&#363;ra plateau, residing only in the Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d,
Nim&#257;r, Bet&#363;l and Chhindw&#257;ra Districts. About 30,000
Korkus dwell in the Ber&#257;r plain adjoining the Satp&#363;ras, and a
few thousand belong to Bhop&#257;l. The word Korku means simply
&lsquo;men&rsquo; or &lsquo;tribesmen,&rsquo; <i>koru</i> being their
term for a man and <i>k&#363;</i> a plural termination. The tribe have
a language of their own, which resembles that of the Kols of Chota
N&#257;gpur. The language of the Korwas, another Munda tribe found in
Chota N&#257;gpur, is also known as Korak&#363; or Kork&#363;, and one
of their subcastes has the same name.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e17535src" href="#xd21e17535" name="xd21e17535src">2</a> Some
Korkus or Mow&#257;sis are found in Chota N&#257;gpur, and Colonel
Dalton considered them a branch of the Korwas. Another argument may be
adduced from the sept names of the Korkus <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb551" href="#pb551" name="pb551">551</a>]</span>which are in many
cases identical with those of the Kols and Korwas. There is little
reason to doubt then that the Korkus are the same tribe as the Korwas,
and both of these may be taken to be offshoots of the great Kol or
Munda tribe. The Korkus have come much further west than their kinsmen,
and between their residence on the Mah&#257;deo or western Satp&#363;ra
hills and the Korwas and Kols, there lies a large expanse mainly
peopled by the Gonds and other Dravidian tribes, though with a
considerable sprinkling of Kols in Mandla, Jubbulpore and
Bil&#257;spur. These latter may have immigrated in comparatively recent
times, but the Kolis of Bombay may not improbably be another offshoot
of the Kols, who with the Korkus came west at a period before the
commencement of authentic history.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17544src"
href="#xd21e17544" name="xd21e17544src">3</a> One of the largest
subdivisions of the Korkus is termed Mow&#257;si, and this name is
sometimes applied to the whole tribe, while the tract of country where
they dwell was formerly known as the Mow&#257;s. Numerous derivations
of this term have been given, and the one commonly accepted is that it
signifies &lsquo;The troubled country,&rsquo; and was applied to the
hills at the time when bands of Koli or Korku freebooters, often led by
dispossessed R&#257;jp&#363;t chieftains, harried the rich lowlands of
Ber&#257;r from their hill forts on the Satp&#363;ras, exacting from
the Mar&#257;thas, with poetical justice, the payments known as
&lsquo;Tankha Mow&#257;si&rsquo; for the ransom of the settled and
peaceful villages of the plains. The fact, however, that the Korkus
found in Chota N&#257;gpur are also known as Mow&#257;si militates
against this supposition, for if the name was applied only to the
Korkus of the Satp&#363;ra plateau it would hardly have travelled as
far east as Chota N&#257;gpur. Mr. Hislop derived it from the mahua
tree. But at any rate Mow&#257;si meant a robber to Mar&#257;tha ears,
and the forests of Kal&#299;bh&#299;t and Melgh&#257;t are known as the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">According to their own traditions the Korkus like so
many other early people were born from the soil. They state that
R&#257;wan, the demon king of Ceylon, observed that the Vindhyan and
Satp&#363;ra ranges were uninhabited and besought Mah&#257;deo<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e17557src" href="#xd21e17557" name=
"xd21e17557src">4</a> to populate them. Mah&#257;deo despatched his
messenger, the crow K&#257;geshwar, to find for him an ant-hill
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb552" href="#pb552" name=
"pb552">552</a>]</span>made of red earth, and the crow discovered such
an ant-hill between the Saol&#299;garh and Bh&#257;nwargarh ranges of
Bet&#363;l. Mah&#257;deo went to the place, and, taking a handful of
red earth, made images in the form of a man and a woman, but
immediately two fiery horses sent by Indra rose from the earth and
trampled the images to dust. For two days Mah&#257;deo persisted in his
attempts, but as often as the images were made they were destroyed in a
similar manner. But at length the god made an image of a dog and
breathed into it the breath of life, and this dog kept off the horses
of Indra. Mah&#257;deo then made again his two images of a man and
woman, and giving them human life, called them M&#363;la and M&#363;lai
with the surname of Pothre, and these two became the ancestors of the
Korku tribe. Mah&#257;deo then created various plants for their use,
the <i>mahul</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e17564src" href=
"#xd21e17564" name="xd21e17564src">5</a> from whose strong and fibrous
leaves they could make aprons and head-coverings, the wild plantain
whose leaves would afford other clothing, and the mahua, the
<i>chironji</i>, the <i>sewan</i> and <i>kullu</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e17577src" href="#xd21e17577" name="xd21e17577src">6</a> to
provide them with food. Time went on and M&#363;la and M&#363;lai had
children, and being dissatisfied with their condition as compared with
that of their neighbours, besought Mah&#257;deo to visit them once
more. When he appeared M&#363;la asked the god to give him grain to eat
such as he had heard of elsewhere on the earth. Mah&#257;deo sent the
crow K&#257;geshwar to look for grain, and he found it stored in the
house of a M&#257;ng named Japre who lived at some distance within the
hills. Japre on hearing what was required besought the honour of a
visit from the god himself. Mah&#257;deo went, and Japre laid before
him an offering of 12 <i>khandis</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e17593src" href="#xd21e17593" name="xd21e17593src">7</a> of grain,
12 goats and 12 buckets of water, and invited Mah&#257;deo to eat and
drink. The god was pleased with the offering and unwilling to reject
it, but considered that he could not eat food defiled by the touch of
the outcaste M&#257;ng, so P&#257;rvati created the giant Bh&#299;msen
and bade him eat up the food offered to Mah&#257;deo. When Bh&#299;msen
had finished the offering, however, it occurred to him that he also had
been defiled by taking food from a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb553"
href="#pb553" name="pb553">553</a>]</span>M&#257;ng, and in revenge he
destroyed Japre&rsquo;s house and covered the site of it with
d&eacute;bris and dirt. Japre then complained to Mah&#257;deo of this
sorry requital of his offering and prayed to have his house restored to
him. Bh&#299;msen was ordered to do this, and agreed to comply on
condition that M&#363;la should pay to him the same honour and worship
as he accorded to R&#257;wan, the demon king. M&#363;la promised to do
so, and Bh&#299;msen then sent the crow K&#257;geshwar to the tank
Daldal, bidding him bring thence the pig Buddu, who being brought was
ordered to eat up all the dirt that covered Japre&rsquo;s house. Buddu
demurred except on condition that he also should be worshipped by
M&#363;la and his descendants for ever. M&#363;la agreed to pay worship
to him every third year, whereupon Buddu ate up all the dirt, and dying
from the effects received the name of Mah&#257;bissum, under which he
is worshipped to the present day. Mah&#257;deo then took some seed from
the M&#257;ng and planted it for M&#363;la&rsquo;s use, and from it
sprang the seven grains&mdash;<i>kodon</i>, <i>kutki</i>, <i>gurgi</i>,
<i>mandgi</i>, <i>barai</i>, <i>r&#257;la</i> and
<i>dh&#257;n</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e17619src" href=
"#xd21e17619" name="xd21e17619src">8</a> which the Korkus principally
cultivate. It may be noticed that the story ingeniously accounts for
and sheds as it were an orthodox sanction on the custom of the Korkus
of worshipping the pig and the local demon Bh&#299;msen, who is placed
on a sort of level with R&#257;wan, the opponent of R&#257;ma. After
recounting the above story Mr. Crosthwaite remarks: &ldquo;This legend
given by the Korkus of their creation bears a curious analogy to our
own belief as set forth in the Old Testament. They even give the
tradition of a flood, in which a crow plays the part of Noah&rsquo;s
dove. There is a most curious similarity between their belief in this
respect and that found in such distant and widely separated parts as
Otaheite and Siberia. Remembering our own name &lsquo;Adam,&rsquo;
which I believe means in Hebrew &lsquo;made of red earth,&rsquo; it is
curious to observe the stress that is laid in the legend on the
necessity for finding red earth for the making of man.&rdquo; Another
story told by the Korkus with the object of providing themselves with
R&#257;jp&#363;t ancestry is to the effect that their forefathers dwelt
in the city of Dh&#257;r&#257;nagar, the modern Dh&#257;r. It happened
one day that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb554" href="#pb554" name=
"pb554">554</a>]</span>they were out hunting and followed a
<i>s&#257;mbhar</i> stag, which fled on and on until it finally came to
the Mah&#257;deo or Pachmarhi hills and entered a cave. The hunters
remained at the mouth waiting for the stag to come out, when a hermit
appeared and gave them a handful of rice. This they at once cooked and
ate as they were hungry from their long journey, and they found to
their surprise that the rice sufficed for the whole party to eat their
fill. The hermit then told them that he was the god Mah&#257;deo, and
had assumed the form of a stag in order to lead them to these hills,
where they were to settle and worship him. They obeyed the command of
the god, and a Korku zam&#299;nd&#257;r is still the hereditary
guardian of Mah&#257;deo&rsquo;s shrine at Pachmarhi. This story has of
course no historical value, and the Korkus have simply stolen the city
of Dh&#257;r&#257;nagar for their ancestral home from their neighbours
the Bhoyars and Panw&#257;rs. These castes relate similar stories,
which may in their case be founded on fact.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">3. Tribal subdivisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As is usual among the forest tribes the Korkus
formerly had a subdivision called R&#257;j-Kork&#363;, who were made up
of landowning members of the caste and were admitted to rank among
those from whom a Br&#257;hman would take water, while in some cases a
spurious R&#257;jp&#363;t ancestry was devised for them, as in the
story given above. The remainder of the tribe were called Potharia, or
those to whom a certain dirty habit is imputed. These main divisions
have, however, become more or less obsolete, and have been supplanted
by four subcastes with territorial names, Mow&#257;si, B&#257;waria,
R&#363;ma and Bondoya. The meaning of the term Mow&#257;si has already
been given, and this subcaste ranks as the highest, probably owing to
the gentlemanly calling of armed robbery formerly practised by its
members. The B&#257;warias are the dwellers in the Bh&#257;nwargarh
tract of Bet&#363;l, the R&#363;mas those who belong to B&#257;sim and
Gangra in the Amraoti District, and the Bondoyas the residents of the
J&#299;tgarh and Pachmarhi tract. These last are also called
Bhovad&#257;ya and Bhopa, and this name has been corrupted into Bopchi
in the Wardha District, a few hundred Bondoya Korkus who live there
being known as Bopchi and considered a distinct caste. Except among the
Mow&#257;sis, who usually marry in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb555"
href="#pb555" name="pb555">555</a>]</span>their own subcaste, the rule
of endogamy is not strictly observed. The above description refers to
Bet&#363;l and Nim&#257;r, but in Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d, Mr.
Crosthwaite says: &ldquo;Four-fifths of the Korkus have been so
affected by the spread of Br&#257;hmanical influence as to have ceased
to differ in any marked way from the Hindu element in the population,
and the Korku has become so civilised as to have learnt to be ashamed
of being a Korku.&rdquo; Each subcaste has traditionally 36 exogamous
septs, but the numbers have now increased. The sept names are generally
taken from those of plants and animals. These were no doubt originally
totemistic, but the Korkus now say that the names are derived from
trees and other articles in or behind which the ancestors of each sept
took refuge after being defeated in a great battle. Thus the ancestor
of the Atkul sept hid in a gorge, that of the Bh&#363;ri R&#257;na sept
behind a dove&rsquo;s nest, that of the Dewda sept behind a rice plant,
that of the J&#257;mbu sept behind a <i>j&#257;mun</i> tree,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e17661src" href="#xd21e17661" name=
"xd21e17661src">9</a> that of the K&#257;sada sept in the bed of a
river, that of the T&#257;khar sept behind a cucumber plant, that of
the Sakum sept behind a teak tree, and so on. Other names are Banku or
a forest-dweller; Bh&#363;rswa or Bhoyar, perhaps from the caste of
that name; Basam or Baoria, the god of beehives; and Marskola or
Maw&#257;si, which the Korkus take to mean a field flooded by rain. One
sept has the name Kill&#299;bhasam, and its ancestor is said to have
eaten the flesh of a heifer half-devoured by a tiger and parched by a
forest fire. In Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d the legend of the battle is not
known, and among the names given by Mr. Crosthwaite are Akandi, the
benighted one; Tandil, a rat; and Chuthar, the flying black-bug. In a
few cases the names of septs are Hindi or Mar&#257;thi words, these
perhaps affording a trace of the foundation of separate families by
members of other castes. No totemistic usages are followed as a rule,
but one curious instance may be given. One sept has the name
<i>lobo</i>, which means a piece of cloth. But the word <i>lobo</i>
also signifies &lsquo;to leak.&rsquo; If a person says a sentence
containing the word <i>lobo</i> in either signification before a member
of the sept while he is eating, he will throw away the food before him
as if it were contaminated and prepare a meal afresh. <span class=

name="xd21e17677src">10</a> consider the regular marriage of girls to
be inauspicious, and the members of these simply give away their

<h3 class="main">4. Marriage Betrothal.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage between members of the same sept is
prohibited and also the union of first cousins. The preliminaries to a
marriage commence with the <i>b&#257;li-d&#363;dna</i> or arrangement
of the match. The boy&rsquo;s father having selected a suitable bride
for his son sends two elders of the caste to propose the match to her
father, who as a matter of etiquette invariably declines it, swearing
with great oaths that he will not allow his daughter to get married or
that he will have a son-in-law who will serve for her. The messengers
depart, but return again and again until the father&rsquo;s obduracy is
overcome, which may take from six months to two years, while from nine
to twelve months is considered a respectable period. When his consent
is finally obtained the residents of the girl&rsquo;s village are
called to hear it, and the compact is sealed with large potations of
liquor. A ceremony of betrothal follows at which the <i>daij</i> or
dowry is arranged, this signifying among the Korkus the compensation to
be paid to the girl&rsquo;s father for the loss of her services. It is
computed by a curious system of symbolic higgling. The women of the
girl&rsquo;s party take two plates and place on them two heaps
containing respectively ten and fifty seeds of a sort used for
reckoning. The ten seeds on the first plate represent five rupees for
the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> and five cloths for the mother, brother,
paternal aunt and paternal and maternal uncles of the girl. The heap of
fifty seeds indicates that Rs. 50 must be paid to the girl&rsquo;s
father. When the plates are received by the boy&rsquo;s party they take
away forty-five of the seeds from the larger heap and return the plate,
to indicate that they will only pay five rupees to the girl&rsquo;s
father. The women add twenty-five seeds and send back the plate again.
The men then take away fifteen, thus advancing the bride-price to
fifteen rupees. The women again add twenty-five seeds and send back the
plate, and the men again take away twenty, and returning the remaining
twenty which are taken as the sum agreed upon, in addition to the five
cloths and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb557" href="#pb557" name=
"pb557">557</a>]</span>five rupees for the <i>panch&#257;yat</i>. The
total amount paid averages about Rs. 60. Wealthy men sometimes refuse
this payment or exchange a bride for a bridegroom. The dowry should be
paid before the wedding, and in default of this the bridegroom&rsquo;s
father is made not a little uncomfortable at that festival. Should a
betrothed girl die before marriage, the dowry does not abate and the
parents of the girl have a right to stop her burial until it is paid.
But if a father shows himself hard to please and refuses eligible
offers, or if a daughter has fallen in love, as sometimes happens, she
will leave her home quietly some morning and betake herself to the
house of the man of her choice. If her young affections have not been
engaged, she may select of her own accord a protector whose
circumstances and position make him attractive, and preferably one
whose mother is dead. Occasionally a girl will install herself in the
house of a man who does not want her, and his position then is truly
pitiable. He dare not turn her out as he would be punished by the caste
for his want of gallantry, and his only course is to vacate his own
house and leave her in possession. After a time his relations represent
to her that the man she wants has gone on a journey and will not be
back for a long time, and induce her to return to the paternal abode.
But such a case is very rare.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. The marriage ceremony.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The marriage ceremony resembles that of the Hindus but
has one or two special features. After the customary cleaning of the
house which should be performed on a Tuesday, the bridegroom is carried
to the heap of stones which represents Mutua Deo, and there the Bhumka
or priest invokes the various sylvan deities, offering to them the
blood of chickens. Again when he is dressed for the wedding the boy is
given a knife or dagger carrying a pierced lemon on the blade, and he
and his parents and relatives proceed to a <i>ber</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e17711src" href="#xd21e17711" name="xd21e17711src">11</a> or
wild plum tree. The boy and his parents sit at the foot of the tree and
are tied to it with a thread, while the Bhumka again spills the blood
of a fowl on the roots of the tree and invokes the sun and moon, whom
the Korkus consider to be their ultimate ancestors. The <i>ber</i>
fruit may perhaps be selected as symbolising the red orb of the setting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb558" href="#pb558" name=
"pb558">558</a>]</span>sun. The party then dance round the tree. When
the wedding procession is formed the following ceremony takes place: A
blanket is spread in the yard of the house and the bridegroom and his
elder brother&rsquo;s wife are made to stand on it and embrace each
other seven times. This may probably be a survival of the modified
system of polyandry still practised by the Khonds, under which the
younger brothers are allowed access to the elder brother&rsquo;s wife
until their own marriage. The ceremony would then typify the cessation
of this intercourse at the wedding of the boy. The procession must
reach the bride&rsquo;s village on a Monday, a Wednesday or a Friday, a
breach of this rule entailing a fine of Rs. 8 on the boy&rsquo;s
father. On arrival at the bride&rsquo;s village its progress is barred
by a rope stretched across the road by the bride&rsquo;s relatives, who
must be given two pice each before it is removed. The bridegroom
touches the marriage-shed with a bamboo fan. Next day the couple are
seated in the shed and covered with a blanket on to which water is
poured to symbolise the fertilising influence of rain. The groom ties a
necklace of beads to the girl&rsquo;s neck, and the couple are then
lifted up by the relatives and carried three times round the yard of
the house, while they throw yellow-coloured rice at each other. Their
clothes are tied together and they proceed to make an offering to Mutua
Deo. In Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d, Mr. Crosthwaite states, the marriage
ceremony is presided over by the bridegroom&rsquo;s aunt or other
collateral female relative. The bride is hidden in her father&rsquo;s
house. The aunt then enters carrying the bridegroom and searches for
the bride. When the bride is found the brother-in-law of the bridegroom
takes her up, and bride and bridegroom are then seated under a sheet.
The rings worn on the little finger of the right hand are exchanged
under the sheet and the clothes of the couple are knotted together.
Then follow the <i>sapta padi</i> or seven steps round the post, and
the ceremony concludes with a dance, a feast and an orgy of
drunkenness. A priest takes no part in a Korku marriage ceremony, which
is a purely social affair. If a man has only one daughter, or if he
requires an assistant for his cultivation, he often makes his
prospective son-in-law serve for his wife for a period varying from
five to twelve years, the marriage being <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb559" href="#pb559" name="pb559">559</a>]</span>then celebrated at
the father-in-law&rsquo;s expense. If the boy runs away with the girl
before the end of his service, his parents have to pay to the
girl&rsquo;s father five rupees for each year of the unexpired term.
Marriage is usually adult, girls being wedded between the ages of ten
and sixteen and boys at about twenty. Polygamy is freely practised by
those who are well enough off to afford it, and instances are known of
a man having as many as twelve wives living. A man must not marry his
wife&rsquo;s younger sister if she is the widow of a member of his own
sept nor his elder brother&rsquo;s widow if she is his wife&rsquo;s
elder sister. Widow-marriage is allowed, and divorce may be effected by
a simple proclamation of the fact to the <i>panch&#257;yat</i> in a
caste assembly.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">6. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Korkus consider themselves as Hindus, and are held
to have a better claim to a place in the social structure of Hinduism
than most of the other forest tribes, as they worship the sun and moon
which are Hindu deities and also Mah&#257;deo. In truth, however, their
religion, like that of many low Hindu castes, is almost purely
animistic. The sun and moon are their principal deities, the name for
these luminaries in their language being Gomaj, which is also the term
for god or a god. The head of each family offers a white she-goat and a
white fowl to the sun every third year, and the Korkus stand with the
face to the sun when beginning to sow, and perform other ceremonies
with the face turned to the east. The moon has no special observances,
but as she is a female deity she is probably considered to participate
in those paid to the sun. These gods are, however, scarcely expected to
interest themselves in the happenings of a Korku&rsquo;s daily life,
and the local godlings who are believed to regulate these are therefore
propitiated with greater fervour. The three most important village
deities are Dongar Deo, the god of the hills, who resides on the
nearest hill outside the village and is worshipped at Dasahra with
offerings of cocoanuts, limes, dates, vermilion and a goat; Mutua Deo,
who is represented by a heap of stones within the village and receives
a pig for a sacrifice, besides special oblations when disease and
sickness are prevalent; and M&#257;ta, the goddess of smallpox, to whom
cocoanuts and sweetmeats, but no animal sacrifices, are offered.

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">7. The Bhumka.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The priests of the Korkus are of two
kinds&mdash;Parih&#257;rs and Bhumkas. The Parih&#257;r may be any man
who is visited with the divine afflatus or selected as a mouthpiece by
the deity; that is to say, a man of hysterical disposition or one
subject to epileptic fits. He is more a prophet than a priest, and is
consulted only on special occasions. Parih&#257;rs are also rare, but
every village has its Bhumka, who performs the regular sacrifices to
the village gods and the special ones entailed by disease or other
calamities. On him devolves the dangerous duty of keeping tigers out of
the boundaries. When a tiger visits the village the Bhumka repairs to
B&#257;gh Deo<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17741src" href="#xd21e17741"
name="xd21e17741src">12</a> and makes an offering to the god, promising
to repeat it for so many years on condition that the tiger does not
appear for that time. The tiger on his part never fails to fulfil the
contract thus silently made, for he is pre-eminently an honourable
upright beast, not faithless and treacherous like the leopard whom no
contract can bind. Some Bhumkas, however, masters of the most powerful
spells, are not obliged to rely on the traditional honour of the tiger,
but compel his attendance before B&#257;gh Deo; and such a Bhumka has
been seen as a very Daniel among tigers muttering his incantations over
two or three at a time as they crouched before him. Of one Bhumka in
K&#257;libh&#299;t it is related that he had a fine large
<i>s&#257;j</i> tree, into which, when he uttered his spells, he would
drive a nail, and on this the tiger came and ratified the compact with
his enormous paw, with which he deeply scored the bark. In this way
some have lost their lives, victims of misplaced confidence in their
own powers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17747src" href="#xd21e17747"
name="xd21e17747src">13</a> If a man is sick and it is desired to
ascertain what god or spirit of an ancestor has sent the malady, a
handful of grain is waved over the sick man and then carried to the
Bhumka. He makes a heap of it on the floor, and, sitting over it,
swings a lighted lamp suspended by four strings from his fingers. He
then repeats slowly the name of the village deities and the sick
man&rsquo;s ancestors, pausing between each, and the name at which the
lamp stops swinging is that of the offended one. He then inquires in a
similar <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb561" href="#pb561" name=
"pb561">561</a>]</span>manner whether the propitiation shall be a pig,
a chicken, a goat, a cocoanut and so on. The office of Bhumka is
usually, but not necessarily, hereditary, and a new one is frequently
chosen by lot, this being also done when a new village is founded. All
the villagers then sit in a line before the shrine of Mutua Deo, to
whom a black and a white chicken are offered. The Parih&#257;r, or, if
none be available, the oldest man present, then sets a
<i>pai</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e17757src" href="#xd21e17757"
name="xd21e17757src">14</a> rolling before the line of men, and the
person before whom it stops is marked out by this intervention of the
deity as the new Bhumka. When a new village is to be founded a pai
measure is filled with grain to a level with the brim, but with no head
(this being known as a <i>mundi</i> or bald <i>pai</i>), and is placed
before Mutua Deo in the evening and watched all night. In the morning
the grain is poured out and again replaced in the measure; if it now
fills this and also leaves enough for a head, and still more if it
brims and runs over, it is a sign that the village will be very
prosperous and that every cultivator&rsquo;s granaries will run over in
the same way. But it is an evil omen if the grain does not fill up to
the level of the rim of the measure. The explanation of the difference
in bulk may be that the grains increase or decrease slightly in size
according as the atmosphere is moist or dry, or perhaps the Bhumka
works the oracle. The Bhumka usually receives contributions in grain
from all the houses in the village; but occasionally each cultivator
gives him a day&rsquo;s ploughing, a day&rsquo;s weeding and a
day&rsquo;s wood-cutting free. The Bhumka is also employed in Hindu
villages for the service of the village gods. But the belief in the
powers of these deities is decaying, and with it the tribute paid to
the Bhumka for securing their favour. Whereas formerly he received
substantial contributions of grain on the same scale as a village
menial, the cultivator will now often put him off with a basketful or
even a handful, and say, &lsquo;I cannot spare you any more, Bhumka;
you must make all the gods content with that.&rsquo; In curing diseases
the Parih&#257;r resorts to swindling tricks. He will tell the sick man
that a sacrifice is necessary, asking for a goat if the patient can
afford one. He will say it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb562" href=
"#pb562" name="pb562">562</a>]</span>must be of a particular colour, as
all black, white or red, so that the sick man&rsquo;s family may have
much trouble in finding one, and they naturally think the sacrifice is
more efficacious in proportion to the difficulty they experience in
arranging for it. If they cannot afford a goat the Parih&#257;r tells
them to sacrifice a cock, and requires one whose feathers curl
backwards, as they occasionally do. If the family is very poor any
chicken which has come out of the shell, so long as it has a beak, will
do duty for a cock. If a man has a pain in his body the Parih&#257;r
will suck the place and produce small pieces of bone from his mouth,
stained with vermilion to imitate blood, and say that he has extracted
them from the patient&rsquo;s body. Perhaps the idea may be that the
bones have been caused to enter his body and make him ill by the
practice of magic. Formerly the Parih&#257;r had to prove his
supernatural powers by whipping himself on the back with a rope into
which the ends of nails were twisted, and to continue this ordeal for a
period long enough to satisfy the villagers that he could not have
borne it without some divine assistance. But this salutary custom has
fallen into abeyance.</p>

<h3 class="main">8. Magical practices.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Korkus have the same belief in the efficacy of
imitative and sympathetic magic as other primitive peoples.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e17774src" href="#xd21e17774" name=
"xd21e17774src">15</a> Thus to injure an enemy, a clay image of him is
made and pierced with a knife, in the belief that the real person will
suffer in the same manner. If the clay can be taken from a place where
his foot has made an impression in walking, or the image wrapped round
with his hair, the charm is more efficacious. Or an image may be made
with charcoal on some stolen portion of his apparel, and similarly
wrapped in his hair; it is then burnt in the belief that the real
person will be attacked by fever. Sometimes the image is buried in a
place where it is likely that the victim will walk over it, when the
same result is hoped for. In order to produce rain, a frog, as the
animal delighting in the element of water, is caught and slung on a
stick; the boys and girls then carry it from house to house and the
householders pour water over it. If it is desired to stop rain a frog
is caught and buried alive, this being done by a naked boy. Another
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb563" href="#pb563" name=
"pb563">563</a>]</span>device for producing rain is to yoke two naked
women to a plough, who are then driven across a field like bullocks and
goaded by a third naked woman. This device may possibly be intended to
cause the gods to send rain, by showing how the natural order of the
world is upset and reversed by the continued drought. In order to stop
rain an unmarried youth collects water in a new earthen pot from the
eaves and buries it below the hearth so that the water may disappear by
evaporation and the rain may cease in the same manner. Another method
is to send a man belonging to the K&#257;sada
sept&mdash;<i>K&#257;sada</i> meaning slime&mdash;to bring a plough
from the field and place it in his house. He also stops bathing or
washing for the period for which a break in the rains is required, and
the idea is perhaps that as the man whose name and nature are mud or
slime is dry so the mud on the earth will dry up; and as the plough is
dry, the ploughed fields which have been in contact with it will also
become dry. In order to produce a quarrel the quills of a porcupine are
smoked with the burnt parings of an enemy&rsquo;s nails and deposited
in the eaves of his house. And as the fretful porcupine raises his
quills when angry with an enemy, these will have the effect of causing
strife among the members of the household. If a person wishes to
transfer his sickness to another, he obtains the latter&rsquo;s cloth
and draws on it with lamp-black two effigies, one upright and the other
upside down. As soon as the owner puts on the cloth, he will fall a
victim to the ailment of the person who drew the effigies. In order to
obtain children the hair of a woman who has borne several is secured by
a barren woman and buried below her bathing-stone, when the quality of
fertility will be transferred to her from the owner of the hair. In
order to facilitate child-birth a twisted thread is untwined before the
eyes of the pregnant woman with the idea that the delivery will thus be
made direct and easy; or she is given water to drink in which her
husband&rsquo;s left leg, a gun-barrel, a pestle, or a thunder-bolt has
been washed; it being supposed that as each of these articles has the
quality of direct and powerful propulsion, this quality will be
conveyed to the woman and enable her to propel the child from her womb.
The Korkus also trust largely to omens. It is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb564" href="#pb564" name=
"pb564">564</a>]</span>inauspicious when starting out on some business
to see a black-faced monkey or a hare passing either on the left or
right, or a snake crossing in front. A person seeing any of these will
usually return and postpone his business to a more favourable occasion.
It is a bad omen for a hen to cackle or lay eggs at night. One sneeze
is a bad omen, but two neutralise the effect and are favourable. An
empty pot is a bad omen and a full one good. To break a pot when
commencing any business is fatal, and shows that the work will come to
naught. Thursdays and Fridays are favourable days for working, and
Mondays and Tuesdays for propitiating one&rsquo;s ancestors. Odd
numbers are lucky. In order to lay to rest the spirit of a dead person,
who it is feared may trouble the living, five pieces of bamboo are
taken as representing the bones of the dead man, and these with five
crab&rsquo;s legs, five grains of rice and other articles are put into
a basket and thrust into a crab&rsquo;s hole under water. The occasion
is made an excuse for much feasting and drinking, and the son or other
representative who lays the spirit works himself up into a state of
drunken excitement before he enters the water to search for a suitable
hole. The fat of a tiger is considered to be an excellent medicine for
rheumatism and sprains, and much store is set by it. The tiger&rsquo;s
tongue is also supposed to be a very powerful tonic or strengthening
medicine for weakly children. It is cooked, pounded up, and a small
quantity administered in milk or water. When a tiger has been killed
the Gonds and Korkus will singe off his whiskers, as they think this
will prevent the tiger&rsquo;s spirit from haunting them. Another idea
is that the whiskers if chopped up and mixed in the food of an enemy
will poison him. They frequently object to touch a man who has been
injured or mauled by a tiger, as they think that to do so would bring
down the tiger&rsquo;s vengeance on them. And in some places any Gond
or Korku who touches a man mauled by a tiger is put temporarily out of
caste and has to be purified and give a feast on readmission.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">9. Funeral rites.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dead are usually buried, two pice being first
thrown into the grave to buy the site. The body is laid on its back,
naked and with the head pointing to the south. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb565" href="#pb565" name="pb565">565</a>]</span>The
earth is mixed with briars and thorns while being filled in so as to
keep off hyenas, and stones are placed over the grave. No fixed period
of mourning is observed, but after the lapse of some days, the
deceased&rsquo;s family or relatives go to the burial-place, taking
with them a piece of turmeric. This they cut into strips, and, placing
them in a leaf-cup, pour water over them. As the water falls on the
tomb, a god is called to witness that this day the dead man&rsquo;s
spirit has been sent to live with the ancestors. The pieces of turmeric
are then tied in a cloth which, after receiving an oblation of
fowl&rsquo;s blood, is suspended from the main beam of the house, this
being considered the dwelling-place of the departed. This ceremony,
called Pitar Miloni, is the first rite for the admission of the
deceased with the spirits of his ancestors, and is preliminary to the
final ceremony of Sedoli which may be performed at any time between
four months and fifteen years after the death. But until it is complete
the spirit of the deceased has not been laid finally to rest and has
the power of sending aches and pains to molest the bodies of its living
relatives. Each sept has a place in which the Sedoli rites must be
performed, and however far the Korku may have wandered from the
original centre of his tribe, he must return there to set his
father&rsquo;s spirit at rest and enable it to join the ancestral
ghosts. When the Sedoli is to be performed an unblemished teak or
<i>salai</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e17793src" href="#xd21e17793"
name="xd21e17793src">16</a> tree is selected and wrapped round with a
thread, while seven circuits of it are made and a bottle of liquor and
two pice are offered as purchase money. It is then cut down and brought
home, and from it a smooth stake called <i>m&#363;nda</i> is fashioned,
24 to 30 inches high, and squared or pointed at the top, often being
arrow-headed. On it are carved representations of the sun and moon, a
spider and a human ear, and below these a figure representing the
principal person in whose honour the stake is erected, on horseback
with weapons in his hand. The proper method is to have one
<i>m&#363;nda</i> for each ancestor, but poor persons make one do for
several and their figures are then carved below. But care must be taken
that the total number of figures representing the dead does not exceed
that of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb566" href="#pb566" name=
"pb566">566</a>]</span>members of the family who have died during the
period for which the Sedoli is performed. For in that case another
person is likely to die for each extra figure. The little bags of
turmeric representing the ancestors are then taken from the main beam
of the house and carried with the <i>m&#363;nda</i> to the
burial-place. There a goat is sacrificed and these articles are
besmeared with its blood, after which a feast is held accompanied by
singing and dancing. Next day the party again go to the burial-place
and plant the <i>m&#363;nda</i> in it, placing two pice in the hole
beneath it. They then proceed to the riverside, and, making a little
ball from the flesh of the sacrificed animal, place it together with
the bags of turmeric on a leaf platter, and throw the whole into the
river saying, &lsquo;Ancestors, find your home.&rsquo; If the ball
sinks at once they consider that the ancestors have been successful,
but if any delay takes place, they attribute it to the difficulty
experienced by the ancestors in the selection of a home and throw in
two pice to assist them. The pith of a bamboo may be substituted for
turmeric to represent the bones. The dead are supposed to inhabit a
village of their own similar to that in which they dwelt on earth and
to lead there a colourless existence devoid alike of pleasure and of
pain.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">10. Appearance and social customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following description of the Korkus is given by
Major Forsyth in the Nim&#257;r Settlement Report of 1868&ndash;69,
with the addition of some remarks made by other observers. The Korkus
are well built and muscular. The average Korku has a round face, a nose
rather wide but not flat like a negro&rsquo;s, prominent cheek-bones, a
scanty moustache and his head shaved after the Hindu fashion. They are
slightly taller than the Gond, a shade darker and a good many shades
dirtier. In the wilder parts one may come across some quite too awful
Korkus, from whom an intervening space of fifty yards is an
insufficient protection, though strange to say there are no less than
six words in their language which mean &lsquo;to wash&rsquo;; one to
wash the whole body, one the limbs, one for the face, one for the
mouth, one for the hair and one for the clothes, besides a word for
scouring the body with a stone and another word for bathing in a
stream. Their habitations on the other <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb567" href="#pb567" name="pb567">567</a>]</span>hand present quite a
contrast to their individual want of cleanliness. They build their
villages of a close bamboo wattle-work and with almost Swisslike
neatness, a picturesque site being usually chosen, and the plan being
one long street with a wide open roadway, or several such parallel with
each other. The villages are kept remarkably clean, in striking
contrast to the habitations of other aboriginal tribes. The average
village contains about twenty huts, and it is the custom to bind these
so closely together that forest fires often sweep through a whole
village before a hut can be removed to check their course. The average
hut is about fifteen feet square with a rather flat roof covered with
loose grass over a layer of leaves and pressed down by outside poles.
No nails are required as the posts are bound firmly together with
bamboo or creeper fibre. The inmates generally sleep on the ground, and
a few low stools carved from teak wood serve them for pillows. Every
village has a few pigs and fowls running about, both of which are eaten
after being sacrificed. The Korku is an adept in the crude process of
distillation in which the only apparatus required consists of two
<i>gharas</i> or earthen pots, a hollow bamboo, some mahua flowers,
water and a fire. By this means the Korku manages to produce liquor
upon which he can effectually get drunk. They are by no means
particular about what they eat. Fowls, pork, fish, crabs and tortoise
are all consumed, and beef and rats are eaten in some localities but
not in others. The R&#363;ma and Bondoya Korkus eat buffaloes, and the
latter add monkeys to an already comprehensive dietary. The lowest
caste with whom they are said to eat are Kolis. They do not eat with
Gonds. Gonds, M&#257;ngs, Basors and a few other low castes take food
from them and also, it is said, Bh&#299;ls. The Korkus will freely
admit members of the higher castes into the community, and a woman
incurs no social penalty for a <i>liaison</i> with a member of any
caste from which a Korku can take food. But if she goes wrong with a
low-caste man she is permanently expelled and a fine of Rs. 40 is
exacted from the parents before they are readmitted to social
intercourse. In the case of adultery with a member of the caste, if the
husband does not wish to keep his wife, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb568" href="#pb568" name=
"pb568">568</a>]</span>offending parties have a lock of hair cut off
and give a dinner, and are then considered to be married. But if the
husband does not turn his wife away, he, on his wife&rsquo;s account,
and the seducer must give a joint dinner to the caste. They have a
tribal council or <i>panch&#257;yat</i> which inflicts the usual
penalties for social offences, while in very serious cases, such as
intercourse with a low caste, it causes the offender to be born again.
He is placed inside a large earthen pot which is sealed up, and when
taken out of this he is said to be born again from his mother&rsquo;s
womb. He is then buried in sand and comes out as a fresh incarnation
from the earth, placed in a grass hut which is fired, and from within
which he runs out as it is burning, immersed in water, and finally has
a tuft cut from his scalp-lock and is fined two and a half rupees. The
Korkus as a race are very poor, and a poor Korku manages to exist with
even less clothing than a poor Gond. A loincloth of the scantiest and a
wisp of turban coiled on the top of the head and leaving the centre of
the skull uncovered form his complete costume for dry weather.
Sometimes a large brass chain is worn in the turban or attached to the
waist, and to it are suspended a flint and steel and a small dry gourd
full of cotton&mdash;the implements for obtaining fire. It is also
common to wear a large brass ring in one ear. A special habit of the
Korku in Nim&#257;r, Major Forsyth states, is to carry a small bamboo
flute behind the ear like a pen, from which he discourses a not
unpleasant strain, chiefly when drunk or engaged in propitiating
B&#257;gh Deo, Devi or any other dread power whom he reverences. The
women as a rule wear only a dirty white <i>s&#257;ri</i> and are loaded
with cheap ornaments. Necklaces of beads are worn on the neck, covering
the chest, while the arms and legs are weighed down with brass and
iron.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like most hill tribes the Korkus are remarkably honest
and truthful, slow at calculation and very indignant at being cheated.
They are very improvident and great drunkards, and it is the latter
habit which has aggravated the obstacles to their improvement.</p>

<h3 class="main">12. Inheritance.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Korku law of inheritance differs somewhat from
that of the Hindus. Among them a grandson does not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb569" href="#pb569" name=
"pb569">569</a>]</span>inherit the property of his grandfather unless
it is openly and clearly granted to him during the latter&rsquo;s
lifetime. A married son living separately from his father has no right
of succession to the paternal property, but if he is unmarried, he
receives half the share of a son who is living with his father. A
daughter or a daughter&rsquo;s son does not inherit the father&rsquo;s
property unless it is granted to either of them by a deed of gift. The
sons and mother share equally.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">13. Occupation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Korkus formerly lived principally by hunting, and
practised the shifting cultivation in the forests which is now
forbidden. Very few of them are landowners, but some large
zam&#299;nd&#257;ri estates in Hoshang&#257;b&#257;d and
Chhindw&#257;ra are held by Korku proprietors, who are protected by the
prohibition of alienation. Though too improvident and lazy to be good
cultivators, they are in great request as farmservants and ploughmen,
being too honest to defraud their master of labour or material. A
remarkable change has thus taken place from their former character of
notorious robbers. They cultivate mainly in the hilly tracts and grow
light grains, though some have colonised the waste lands of the upper
Tapti valley in Nim&#257;r and raise good crops of wheat. They do not
as a rule keep cattle other than the few oxen required for cultivating
the soil and hauling out timber. Game of all kinds is caught by means
of heavy log traps for the larger varieties such as s&#257;mbhar, bear
and spotted deer and even leopard; while hares, jungle-fowl and the
smaller sort of game are caught under heavy stones held up by nicely
adjusted strings. Occasionally, when in search of meat, a whole village
will sally out into the forest. The <i>shik&#257;ri</i> has generally a
matchlock concealed in some hiding-place in the jungle, and once he is
posted the others beat towards him and any animal that turns up is shot
at. In the hot weather the water-hole and the bow and arrow play no
small part in helping to fill the Korku larder. Another method of
catching birds is to spread the pounded fruit of a certain parasitic
airplant on a rock. A thick shining gum exudes which so entangles the
feet of the smaller birds as to prevent their escape. Fish dams are
built when the water subsides after the rains, and a cylindrical basket
six or eight feet in length being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb570"
href="#pb570" name="pb570">570</a>]</span>adjusted at the outlet, the
fish are driven into this from above. During the hot season the fruit
of the <i>ghetu</i> is thrown into the pools, and this stupefies the
fish and causes them to float on the surface of the water, where they
are easily caught.</p>

<h3 class="main">14. Language.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Korkus have a language of their own which belongs
to the Kolarian or Munda sub-family. Dr. Grierson says of it:
&ldquo;The Munda, sometimes called the Kolarian family, is probably the
older branch of the Dravido-Munda languages. It exhibits the
characteristics of an agglutinative language to an extraordinarily
complete degree.&rdquo; In the Central Provinces nearly 90 per cent of
Korkus were returned as speaking their own language in 1911. Mr.
Crosthwaite remarks: &ldquo;The language is in a state of decay and
transition, and Hindi and Mar&#257;thi terms have crept into its
vocabulary. But very few Gondi words have been adopted. A grammar of
the Korku language by Drake has been printed at the Baptist Mission
Press, Calcutta.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb571" href=

<p class="first"><b>Korwa.</b> <a class="noteref" id="xd21e17936src"
href="#xd21e17936" name="xd21e17936src">1</a>&mdash;A Kolarian tribe of
the Chota N&#257;gpur plateau. In 1911 about 34,000 Korwas were
returned in the Central Provinces, the great bulk of whom belong to the
Sarg&#363;ja and Jashpur States and a few to the Bil&#257;spur
District. The Korwas are one of the wildest tribes. Colonel Dalton
writes of them:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e17939src" href="#xd21e17939"
name="xd21e17939src">2</a> &ldquo;Mixed up with the Asuras and not
greatly differing from them, except that they are more cultivators of
the soil than smelters, we first meet the Korwas, a few stragglers of
the tribe which under that name take up the dropped links of the
Kolarian chain, and carry it on west, over the Sarg&#363;ja, Jashpur
and Pal&#257;mau highlands till it reaches another cognate tribe, the
K&#363;rs (Korkus) or Mu&#257;sis of Rewah and the Central Provinces,
and passes from the Vindhyan to the Satp&#363;ra range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the fertile valleys that skirt and wind among the plateaus
other tribes are now found intermixed with the Korwas, but all admit
that the latter were first in the field and were at one time masters of
the whole; and we have good confirmatory proof of their being the first
settlers in the fact that for the propitiation of the local spirits
Korwa <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb572" href="#pb572" name=
"pb572">572</a>]</span>Baigas are always selected. There were in
existence within the last twenty years, as highland chiefs and holders
of manors, four Korwa notables, two in Sarg&#363;ja and two in Jashpur;
all four estates were valuable, as they comprised substantial villages
in the fertile plains held by industrious cultivators, and great tracts
of hill country on which were scattered the hamlets of their more
savage followers. The Sarg&#363;ja Korwa chiefs were, however,
continually at strife with the Sarg&#363;ja R&#257;ja, and for various
acts of rebellion against the Lord Paramount lost manor after manor
till to each but one or two villages remained. The two Jashpur thanes
conducted themselves right loyally at the crucial period of the Mutiny
and they are now prosperous gentlemen in full enjoyment of their
estates, the only Korwa families left that keep up any appearance of
respectability. One of them is the hereditary Diw&#257;n of Jashpur,
lord of the mountain tract of Kh&#363;ria and Maini, and chief of
perhaps two-thirds of the whole tribe of Korwas. The other holds an
estate called Kakia comprising twenty-two villages.</p>

<div id="xd21e17948" class="div2 section"><span class=
"pagenum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">2. Physical appearance.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The hill Korwas are the most savage-looking of
all the Kolarian tribes. They are frightfully wild and uncouth in their
appearance, and have good-humouredly accepted the following singular
tradition to account for it. They say that the first human beings that
settled in Sarg&#363;ja, being very much troubled by the depredations
of wild beasts on their crops, put up scarecrows in their fields,
figures made of bamboos dangling in the air, the most hideous
caricatures of humanity that they could devise to frighten the animals.
When the great spirit saw the scarecrow he hit on an expedient to save
his votaries the trouble of reconstructing them. He animated the
dangling figures, thus bringing into existence creatures ugly enough to
frighten all the birds and beasts in creation, and they were the
ancestors of the wild Korwas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This legend is not peculiar to the Korwas but is also told by the
Halbas, Lodhis and other castes, and is a favourite Br&#257;hmanical
device for accounting for the existence of the autochthonous
tribes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Korwas,&rdquo; Dalton continues, &ldquo;are short of
stature and dark brown in complexion, strongly built and active,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb573" href="#pb573" name=
"pb573">573</a>]</span>with good muscular development, but, as appeared
to me, disproportionately short-legged. The average height of twenty
Sarg&#363;ja Korwas that I measured was 5 feet 3 inches and of their
women 4 feet 9 inches only. Notwithstanding the scarecrow tradition the
Korwas are, as a rule, better-looking than the Gonds and Oraons. The
males, I noticed, were more hirsute than the generality of their
cognates, many of them cultivating beards or rather not interfering
with their spontaneous growth, for in truth in their toilets there is
nothing like cultivation. They are as utterly ungroomed as the wildest
animals. The neglected back hair grows in matted tails which fall
behind like badly-frayed ropes, or is massed in a <i>chignon</i> of
gigantic proportions, as preposterous as any that the present tasteless
period has produced; sticking out behind sometimes a foot from the back
of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women appear ground down by the hard work imposed on
them, stunted in growth, black, ugly, and wretchedly clad, some having
only a few dirty rags tied round their persons, and in other respects
untidy and unclean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noticeable that the Korwas have a subtribe called Kor&#257;ku,
and like the Korkus of the Satp&#363;ra range they are called
Mu&#257;si, a term having the meaning of raider or robber. Mr. Crooke
thinks that the Korwas and Korkus are probably branches of the same
tribe, but Sir G. Grierson dissents from this opinion. He states that
the Korwa dialect is most closely related to Asuri and resembles
Mund&#257;ri and Sant&#257;li. The Korwas have the honorific title of
M&#257;njhi, also used by the Sant&#257;ls. The Korba
zam&#299;nd&#257;ri in Bil&#257;spur is probably named after the
Korwas.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">3. Subdivisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The principal subdivisions of the tribe are the
Diharia or Kis&#257;n Korwas, those who live in villages (<i>dih</i>)
and cultivate, and the Pah&#257;ria Korwas of the hills, who are also
called Benwaria from their practising <i>bewar</i> or shifting
cultivation. Two minor groups are the Kor&#257;ku or young men, from
<i>kora</i>, a young man, and the Birjias, who are probably the
descendants of mixed marriages between Korwas and the tribe of that
name, themselves an offshoot of the Baigas. The tribe is also divided
into totemistic exogamous septs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb574"
href="#pb574" name="pb574">574</a>]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd21e17982" class="div2 section"><span class=
"pagenum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">4. Marriage customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage within the sept is forbidden, but this
appears to be the only restriction. In Korba the Pah&#257;ria Korwas
are said to marry their own sisters on occasion. The ordinary
bride-price is Rs. 12. In Bil&#257;spur there is reported to be no
regular marriage feast, but the people dance together round a big
earthen drum, called <i>m&#257;ndhar</i>, which is played in the
centre. This is bound with strips of leather along the sides and
leather faces at the ends to be played on by the hands. They dance in a
circle taking hands, men and women being placed alternately. Among the
Pah&#257;ria Korwas of Sarg&#363;ja, Mr. Kunte states, the consent of
the parents is not required, and boys and girls arrange their own
weddings. Men who can afford the bride-price have a number of wives,
sometimes as many as eight or ten. After she has had a child each wife
lives and cooks her food separately, but gives a part of it to her
husband. The women bring roots and herbs from the forest and feed their
husbands, so that the man with several wives enjoys a larger share of
creature comforts. Among these people adultery is said to be very rare,
but if a woman is detected in adultery she is at once made over to the
partner of her act and becomes his wife. Divorce and the remarriage of
widows are permitted, and a widow usually marries her late
husband&rsquo;s younger brother, though she is not obliged to do so. A
husband divorcing his wife is obliged to feed the caste for five
days.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. Funeral rites.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The tribe bury the dead, placing the corpse in the
grave with the head to the south. A little rice is buried with the
corpse. In Bil&#257;spur the dead are buried in the forest, and the
graves of old men are covered with branches of the
<i>s&#257;l</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e17997src" href="#xd21e17997"
name="xd21e17997src">3</a> tree. Then they go to a little distance and
make a fire, and pour <i>gh&#299;</i> and incense on it as an offering
to the ancestors, and when they hear a noise in the forest they take it
to be the voice of the dead man. When a man dies his hut is broken down
and they do not live in it again. The bodies of children under five are
buried either in the house or under the shade of a banyan tree,
probably with the idea that the spirit will come back and be born
again. They say that a banyan tree is chosen because it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb575" href="#pb575" name=
"pb575">575</a>]</span>lives longest of all trees and is evergreen, and
hence it is supposed that the child&rsquo;s spirit will also live out
its proper span instead of being untimely cut off in its next
birth.</p>

<div id="xd21e18006" class="div2 section"><span class=
"pagenum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">6. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Korwas worship D&#363;lha Deo, the bridegroom god
of the Gonds, and in Sarg&#363;ja their principal deity is Khuria
R&#257;ni, the tutelary goddess of the Khuria plateau. She is a
bloodthirsty goddess and requires animal sacrifices; formerly at
special sacrifices 30 or 40 buffaloes were slaughtered as well as an
unlimited number of goats.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18011src" href=
"#xd21e18011" name="xd21e18011src">4</a> Th&#257;kur Deo, who is
usually considered a corn-god, dwells in a sacred grove, of which no
tree or branch may be cut or broken. The penalty for breach of the
rules is a goat, but an exception is allowed if an animal has to be
pursued and killed in the grove. Th&#257;kur Deo protects the village
from epidemic disease such as cholera and smallpox. The Korwas have
three festivals: the Deoth&#257;n is observed on the full moon day of
P&#363;s (December), and all their gods are worshipped; the Nawanna or
harvest festival falls in Kunw&#257;r (September), when the new grain
is eaten; and the Faguwa or Holi is the common celebration of the
spring and the new vegetation.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">7. Social customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Korwas do not admit outsiders into the tribe. They
will take food from a Gond or Kawar, but not from a Br&#257;hman. A man
is permanently expelled from caste for a <i>liaison</i> with a woman of
the impure G&#257;nda and Ghasia castes, and a woman for adultery with
any person other than a Korwa. Women are tattooed with patterns of dots
on the arms, breasts and feet, and a girl must have this operation done
before she can be married. Neither men nor women ever cut their
hair.</p>

<h3 class="main">8. Dancing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of their appearance at a dance Colonel Dalton
states:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18030src" href="#xd21e18030" name=
"xd21e18030src">5</a> &ldquo;Forming a huge circle, or rather coil,
they hooked on to each other and wildly danced. In their hands they
sternly grasped their weapons, the long stiff bow and arrows with
bright, broad, barbed heads and spirally-feathered reed shafts in the
left hand, and the gleaming battle-axe in the right. Some of the men
accompanied the singing on deep-toned drums and all sang. A few
scantily-clad females formed the inner curl of the coil, but in the
centre <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb576" href="#pb576" name=
"pb576">576</a>]</span>was the Choragus who played on a stringed
instrument, promoting by his grotesque motions unbounded hilarity, and
keeping up the spirit of the dancers by his unflagging energy. Their
matted back hair was either massed into a <i>chignon</i>, sticking out
from the back of the head like a handle, from which spare arrows
depended hanging by the bands, or was divided into clusters of long
matted tails, each supporting a spare arrow, which, flinging about as
they sprang to the lively movements of the dance, added greatly to the
dramatic effect and the wildness of their appearance. The women were
very diminutive creatures, on the average a foot shorter than their
lords, clothed in scanty rags, and with no ornaments except a few tufts
of cotton dyed red taking the place of flowers in the hair, a common
practice also with the Sant&#257;l girls. Both tribes are fond of the
flower of the cockscomb for this purpose, and when that is not
procurable, use the red cotton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They dance the <i>karma</i> dance in the autumn, thinking that it
will procure them good crops, the dance being a kind of ritual or
service and accompanied by songs in praise of the gods. If the rains
fail they dance every night in the belief that the gods will be
propitiated and send rain.</p>

<div id="xd21e18045" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">9. Occupation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of their occupation Colonel Dalton states: &ldquo;The
Korwas cultivate newly cleared ground, changing their homesteads every
two or three years to have command of virgin soil. They sow rice that
ripens in the summer, vetches, millets, pumpkins, cucumbers&mdash;some
of gigantic size&mdash;sweet potatoes, yams and chillies. They also
grow and prepare arrowroot and have a wild kind which they use and
sell. They have as keen a knowledge of what is edible among the
spontaneous products of the jungle as have monkeys, and have often to
use this knowledge for self-preservation, as they are frequently
subjected to failure of crops, while even in favourable seasons some of
them do not raise sufficient for the year&rsquo;s consumption; but the
best of this description of food is neither palatable nor wholesome.
They brought to me nine different kinds of edible roots, and descanted
so earnestly on the delicate flavour and nutritive qualities of some of
them, that I was induced to have two or three varieties cooked under
their instructions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb577" href="#pb577"
name="pb577">577</a>]</span>and served up, but the result was far from
pleasant; my civilised stomach indignantly repelled the savage food,
and was not pacified till it had made me suffer for some hours from
cold sweat, sickness and giddiness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">10. Dacoity.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Korwas in the Tributary States have other
resources than these. They are expert hunters, and to kill a bird
flying or an animal running is their greatest delight. They do not care
to kill their game without rousing it first. They are also very fond of
dacoity and often proceed on expeditions, their victims being usually
travellers, or the Ah&#299;rs who bring large herds of cattle to graze
in the Sarg&#363;ja forests. These cattle do much damage to the village
crops, and hence the Korwas have a standing feud with the herdsmen.
They think nothing of murder, and when asked why he committed a murder,
a Korwa will reply, &lsquo;I did it for my pleasure&rsquo;; but they
despise both house-breaking and theft as cowardly offences, and are
seldom or never guilty of them. The women are also of an adventurous
disposition and often accompany their husbands on raids. Before
starting they take the omens. They throw some rice before a chicken,
and if the bird picks up large solid grains first they think that a
substantial booty is intended, but if it chooses the thin and withered
grains that the expedition will have poor results. One of their bad
omens is that a child should begin to cry before the expedition starts;
and Mr. Kunte, who has furnished the above account, relates that on one
occasion when a Korwa was about to start on a looting expedition his
two-year-old child began to cry. He was enraged at the omen, and
picking up the child by the feet dashed its brains out against a
stone.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">11. Folk-tales.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before going out hunting the Korwas tell each other
hunting tales, and they think that the effect of doing this is to bring
them success in the chase. A specimen of one of these tales is as
follows: There were seven brothers and they went out hunting. The
youngest brother&rsquo;s name was Chilhra. They had a beat, and four of
them lay in ambush with their bows and arrows. A deer came past Chilhra
and he shot an arrow at it, but missed. Then all the brothers
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb578" href="#pb578" name=
"pb578">578</a>]</span>were very angry with Chilhra and they said to
him, &ldquo;We have been wandering about hungry for the whole day, and
you have let our prey escape.&rdquo; Then the brothers got a lot of
<i>m&#257;hul</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e18072src" href=
"#xd21e18072" name="xd21e18072src">7</a> fibre and twisted it into
rope, and from the rope they wove a bag. And they forced Chilhra into
this bag, and tied up the mouth and threw it into the river where there
was a whirlpool. Then they went home. Now Chilhra&rsquo;s bag was
spinning round and round in the whirlpool when suddenly a s&#257;mbhar
stag came out of the forest and walked down to the river to drink
opposite the pool. Chilhra cried out to the s&#257;mbhar to pull his
bag ashore and save him. The s&#257;mbhar took pity on him, and seizing
the bag in his teeth pulled it out of the water on to the bank. Chilhra
then asked the s&#257;mbhar after he had quenched his thirst to free
him from the bag. The s&#257;mbhar drank and then came and bit through
the <i>m&#257;hul</i> ropes till Chilhra could get out. He then
proposed to the s&#257;mbhar to try and get into the bag to see if it
would hold him. The s&#257;mbhar agreed, but no sooner had he got
inside than Chilhra tied up the bag, threw it over his shoulder and
went home. When the brothers saw him they were greatly astonished, and
asked him how he had got out of the bag and caught a s&#257;mbhar, and
Chilhra told them. Then they killed and ate the s&#257;mbhar. Then all
the brothers said to Chilhra that he should tie them up in bags as he
had been tied and throw them into the river, so that they might each
catch and bring home a s&#257;mbhar. So they made six bags and went to
the river, and Chilhra tied them up securely and threw them into the
river, when they were all quickly drowned. But Chilhra went home and
lived happily ever afterwards.</p>
<p>In this story we observe the low standard of moral feeling
noticeable among many primitive races, in the fact that the ingratitude
displayed by Chilhra in deceiving and killing the s&#257;mbhar who had
saved his life conveys no shock to the moral sense of the Korwas. If
the episode had been considered discreditable to the hero Chilhra, it
would not have found a place in the tale.</p>
<p>The following is another folk-tale of the characteristic
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb579" href="#pb579" name=
"pb579">579</a>]</span>type of fairy story found all over the world.
This as well as the last has been furnished by Mr. Narbad Dhanu Sao,
Assistant Manager, Uprora:</p>
<p>A certain rich man, a banker and moneylender (S&#257;hu), had twelve
sons. He got them all married and they went out on a journey to trade.
There came a holy mendicant to the house of the rich man and asked for
alms. The banker was giving him alms, but the saint said he would only
take them from his son or son&rsquo;s wife. As his sons were away the
rich man called his daughter-in-law, and she began to give alms to the
saint. But he caught her up and carried her off. Then her father-in-law
went to search for her, saying that he would not return until he had
found her. He came to the saint&rsquo;s house upon a mountain and said
to him, &lsquo;Why did you carry off my son&rsquo;s wife?&rsquo; The
saint said to him, &lsquo;What can you do?&rsquo; and turned him into
stone by waving his hand. Then all the other brothers went in turn to
search for her down to the youngest, and all were turned into stone. At
last the youngest brother set out to search but he did not go to the
saint, but travelled across the sea and sat under a tree on the other
side. In that tree was the nest with young of the Raigidan and
Jatagidan<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18087src" href="#xd21e18087" name=
"xd21e18087src">8</a> birds. A snake was climbing up the tree to eat
the nestlings, and the youngest brother saw the snake and killed it.
When the parent birds returned the young birds said, &ldquo;We will not
eat or drink till you have rewarded this boy who killed the snake which
was climbing the tree to devour us.&rdquo; Then the parent birds said
to the boy, &lsquo;Ask of us whatever you will and we will give it to
you.&rsquo; And the boy said,&rsquo; I want only a gold parrot in a
gold cage.&rsquo; Then the parent birds said, &ldquo;You have asked
nothing of us, ask for something more; but if you will accept only a
gold parrot in a gold cage wait here a little and we will fly across
the sea and get it for you.&rdquo; So they brought the parrot and cage,
and the youngest brother took them and went home. Immediately the saint
came to him and asked him for the gold parrot and cage because the
saint&rsquo;s soul was in that parrot. Then the youngest brother told
him to dance and he would give him the parrot; and the saint danced,
and his legs and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb580" href="#pb580"
name="pb580">580</a>]</span>arms were broken one after the other, as
often as he asked for the parrot and cage. Then the youngest brother
buried the saint&rsquo;s body and went to his house and passed his
hands before all the stone images and they all came to life again.

"#xd21e18159" name="xd21e18159src">1</a>&mdash;The Mar&#257;tha and
Telugu caste of weavers of silk and fine cotton cloth. They belong
principally to the N&#257;gpur and Chhatt&#299;sgarh Divisions of the
Central Provinces, where they totalled 157,000 persons in 1901, while
1300 were returned from Ber&#257;r. Koshti is the Mar&#257;thi and
S&#257;lew&#257;r the Telugu name. Koshti may perhaps have something to
do with <i>kosa</i> or tasar silk; S&#257;lew&#257;r is said to be from
the Sanskrit S&#257;lika, a weaver,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e18165src" href="#xd21e18165" name="xd21e18165src">2</a> and to be
connected with the common word <i>s&#257;ri</i>, the name for a
woman&rsquo;s cloth; while the English &lsquo;shawl&rsquo; may be a
derivative from the same root. The caste suppose themselves to be
descended from the famous Saint M&#257;rkandi Rishi, who, they say,
first wove cloth from the fibres of the lotus flower to clothe the
nakedness of the gods. In reward for this he was married to the
daughter of S&#363;rya, the sun, and received with her as dowry a giant
named Bhav&#257;ni and a tiger. But the giant was disobedient, and so
M&#257;rkandi killed him, and from his bones fashioned the first
weaver&rsquo;s loom.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18175src" href=
"#xd21e18175" name="xd21e18175src">3</a> The tiger remained obedient to
M&#257;rkandi, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb582" href=
"#pb582" name="pb582">582</a>]</span>Koshtis think that he still
respects them as his descendants; so that if a Koshti should meet a
tiger in the forest and say the name of M&#257;rkandi, the tiger will
pass by and not molest him; and they say that no Koshti has ever been
killed by a tiger. On their side they will not kill or injure a tiger,
and at their weddings the Bh&#257;t or genealogist brings a picture of
a tiger attached to his sacred scroll, known as Padgia, and the Koshtis
worship the picture. A Koshti will not join in a beat for tiger for the
same reason; and other Hindus say that if he did the tiger would single
him out and kill him, presumably in revenge for his breaking the pact
of peace between them. They also worship the Singhw&#257;hini Devi, or
Devi riding on a tiger, from which it may probably be deduced that the
tiger itself was formerly the deity, and has now developed into an
anthropomorphic goddess.</p>

<h3 class="main">2. Subdivisions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste have several subdivisions of different
types. The Halbis appear to be an offshoot of the primitive Halba
tribe, who have taken to weaving; the L&#257;d Koshtis come from
Gujar&#257;t, the Gadhew&#257;l from Garha or Jubbulpore, the Deshkar
and Martha from the Mar&#257;tha country, while the Dewang&#257;n
probably take their name from the old town of that name on the Wardha
river. The Patwis are dyers, and colour the silk thread which the
weavers use to border their cotton cloth. It is usually dyed red with
lac. They also make braid and sew silk thread on ornaments like the
separate Patwa caste. And the Onkule are the offspring of illegitimate
unions. In Ber&#257;r there is a separate subcaste named Hatghar, which
may be a branch of the Dhangar or shepherd caste. Ber&#257;r also has a
group known as Jain Koshtis, who may formerly have professed the Jain
religion, but are now strict Sivites.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e18190src" href="#xd21e18190" name="xd21e18190src">4</a> The
S&#257;lew&#257;rs are said to be divided into the S&#363;ts&#257;le or
thread-weavers, the Padmas&#257;le or those who originally wove the
lotus flower and the Saguns&#257;le, a group of illegitimate descent.
The above names show that the caste is of mixed origin, containing a
large Telugu element, while a body of the primitive Halbas has been
incorporated into it. Many of the Mar&#257;tha Koshtis are probably
Kunbis (cultivators) who have taken up weaving. The caste has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb583" href="#pb583" name=
"pb583">583</a>]</span>also a number of exogamous divisions of the
usual type which serve to prevent the marriage of near relatives.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">3. Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a Koshti wedding in N&#257;gpur, the bride and
bridegroom with their parents sit in a circle, and round them a long
hempen rope is drawn seven times; the bride&rsquo;s mother then holds a
lamp, while the bridegroom&rsquo;s mother pours water from a vessel on
to the floor. The S&#257;lew&#257;rs perform the wedding ceremony at
the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, to which the bride is brought at midnight
for this purpose. A display of fireworks is held and the
<i>th&#363;n</i> or log of wood belonging to the loom is laid on the
ground between the couple and covered with a black blanket. The
bridegroom stands facing the east and places his right foot on the
<i>th&#363;n</i>, and the bride stands opposite to him with her left
foot upon it. A Br&#257;hman holds a curtain between them and they
throw rice upon each other&rsquo;s heads five times and then sit on the
log. The bride&rsquo;s father washes the feet of the bridegroom and
gives him a cloth and bows down before him. The wedding party then
proceed with music and a display of fireworks to the bridegroom&rsquo;s
house and a round of feasts is given continuously for five days.</p>
<p>The remarriage of widows is freely permitted. In Ch&#257;nda if the
widow is living with her father he receives Rs. 40 from the second
husband, but if with her father-in-law no price is given. On the day
fixed for the wedding he fills her lap with nuts, cocoanuts, dates and
rice, and applies vermilion to her forehead. During the night she
proceeds to her new husband&rsquo;s house, and, emptying the fruit from
her lap into a dish which he holds, falls at his feet. The wedding is
completed the next day by a feast to the caste-fellows. The procedure
appears to have some symbolical idea of transferring the fruit of her
womb to her new husband. Divorce is allowed, but is very rare, a wife
being too valuable a helper in the Koshti&rsquo;s industry to be put
away except as a last resort. For a Koshti who is in business on his
own account it is essential to have a number of women to assist in
sizing the thread and fixing it on the loom. A wife is really a
factory-hand and a well-to-do Koshti will buy or occasionally steal as
many women as he can. In Bhand&#257;ra a recent case is known where a
man bought a girl and married her to his son and eight months
afterwards sold her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb584" href="#pb584"
name="pb584">584</a>]</span>to another family for an increased price.
In another case a man mortgaged his wife as security for a debt and in
lieu of interest, and she lived with his creditor until he paid off the
principal. Quarrels over women not infrequently result in cases of
assault and riot.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. Funeral customs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Members of the Ling&#257;yat and Kab&#299;rpanthi
sects bury their dead and the others cremate them. With the
Tirmend&#257;r Koshtis on the fifth day the Ayaw&#257;r priest goes to
the cremation-ground accompanied by the deceased&rsquo;s family and
worships the image of Vishnu and the Tulsi or basil upon the grave; and
after this the whole party take their food at the place. Mourning is
observed during five days for married and three for unmarried persons;
and when a woman has lost her husband she is taken on the fifth day to
the bank of some river or tank and her bangles are broken, her bead
necklace is taken off, the vermilion is rubbed off her forehead, and
her foot ornaments are removed; and these things she must not wear
again while she is a widow. On the fourth day the Panch or caste elders
come and place a new turban on the head of the chief mourner or
deceased&rsquo;s heir; they then take him round the baz&#257;r and seat
him at his loom, where he weaves a little. After this he goes and sits
with the Panch and they take food together. This ceremony indicates
that the impurity caused by the death is removed, and the mourners
return to common life. The caste do not perform the <i>shr&#257;ddh</i>
ceremony, but on the Akh&#257;t&#299;j day or commencement of the
agricultural year a family which has lost a male member will invite a
man from some other family of the caste, and one which has lost a
female member a woman, and will feed the guest with good food in the
name of the dead. In Chhindw&#257;ra during the fortnight of Pitripaksh
or the worship of ancestors, a Koshti family will have a feast and
invite guests of the caste. Then the host stands in the doorway with a
pestle and as the guest comes he bars his entrance, saying: &lsquo;Are
you one of my ancestors; this feast is for my ancestors?&rsquo; To
which the guest will reply: &lsquo;Yes, I am your great-grandfather;
take away the pestle.&rsquo; By this ingenious device the resourceful
Koshti combines the difficult filial duty of the feeding of his
ancestors with the entertainment of his friends. <span class=

<h3 class="main">5. Religion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The principal deity of the Koshtis is Gaj&#257;nand or
Ganpati, whom they revere on the festival of Ganesh Chathurthi or the
fourth day of the month of Bh&#257;don (August). They clean all their
weaving implements and worship them and make an image of Ganpati in
cowdung to which they make offerings of flowers, rice and turmeric. On
this day they do not work and fast till evening, when the image of
Ganpati is thrown into a tank and they return home and eat delicacies.
Some of them observe the <i>T&#299;j</i> or third day of every month as
a fast for Ganpati, and when the moon of the fourth day rises they eat
cakes of dough roasted on a cowdung fire and mixed with butter and
sugar, and offer these to Ganpati. Some of the S&#257;lew&#257;rs are
Vaishnavas and others Ling&#257;yats: the former employ Ayaw&#257;rs
for their <i>gurus</i> or spiritual preceptors and are sometimes known
as Tirmend&#257;r; while the Ling&#257;yats, who are also called
Woheda, have Jangams as their priests. In B&#257;l&#257;gh&#257;t and
Chhatt&#299;sgarh many of the Koshtis belong to the Kab&#299;rpanthi
sect, and these revere the special priests of the sect and abstain from
the use of flesh and liquor. They are also known as Gh&#257;tibandhia,
from the <i>gh&#257;t</i> or string of beads of basil-wool
(<i>tulsi</i>) which they tie round their necks. In Mandla the
Kab&#299;rpanthi Koshtis eat flesh and will intermarry with the others,
who are known distinctively as Saktaha. The Gurmukhis are a special
sect of the N&#257;gpur country and are the followers of a saint named
Koliba B&#257;ba, who lived at Dh&#257;pew&#257;ra near Kalmeshwar. He
is said to have fed five hundred persons with food which was sufficient
for ten and to have raised a Br&#257;hman from the dead in Umrer. Some
Br&#257;hmans wished to test him and told him to perform a miracle, so
he had a lot of brass pots filled with water and put a cloth over them,
and when he withdrew it the water had changed into curded milk. The
Gurmukhis have a descendant of Koliba B&#257;ba for their preceptor,
and each of them keeps a cocoanut in his house, which may represent
Koliba B&#257;ba or else the unseen deity. To this he makes offerings
of sandalwood, rice and flowers. The Gurmukhis are forbidden to
venerate any of the ordinary Hindu deities, but they cannot refrain
from making offerings to M&#257;ta Mai when smallpox breaks out, and if
any person has the disease in his house they refrain from worshipping
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb586" href="#pb586" name=
"pb586">586</a>]</span>the cocoanut so long as it lasts, because they
think that this would be to offer a slight to the smallpox goddess who
is sojourning with them. Another sect is that of the Matw&#257;les who
worship Vishnu as N&#257;r&#257;yan, as well as Siva and Sakti. They
are so called because they drink liquor at their religious feasts. They
have a small platform on which fresh cowdung is spread every day, and
they bow to this before taking their food. Once in four or five years
after a wedding offerings are made to N&#257;r&#257;yan Deo on the bank
of a tank outside the village; chickens and goats are killed and the
more extreme of them sacrifice a pig, but the majority will not join
with these. Offerings of liquor are also made and must be drunk by the
worshippers. Mehras and other low castes also belong to this sect, but
the Koshtis will not eat with them. But in Chhindw&#257;ra it is said
that on the day after the Pola festival in August, when insects are
prevalent and the season of disease begins, the Koshtis and M&#257;ngs
go out together to look for the <i>n&#257;rbod</i> shrub,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e18246src" href="#xd21e18246" name=
"xd21e18246src">5</a> and here they break a small piece of bread and
eat it together. In Bhand&#257;ra the Koshtis worship the spirit of one
Kadu, patel or headman of the village of Mohali, who was imprisoned in
the fort of Amb&#257;garh under an accusation of sorcery in
Mar&#257;tha times and died there. He is known as Ambagarhia Deo, and
the people offer goats and fowls to him in order to be cured of
diseases. The above notice indicates that the caste are somewhat
especially inclined to religious feeling and readily welcome reformers
striving against Hindu polytheism and Br&#257;hman supremacy. This is
probably due in part to the social stigma which attaches to the weaving
industry among the Hindus and is resented as an injustice by the
Koshtis, and in part also to the nature of their calling, which leaves
the mind free for thought during long hours while the fingers are
playing on the loom; and with the uneducated serious reflection must
almost necessarily be of a religious character. In this respect the
Koshti may be said to resemble his fellow-weavers of Thrums. In
N&#257;gpur District the Koshtis observe the Muharram festival, and
many of them go out begging on the first day with a green thread tied
round their body and a beggar&rsquo;s wallet. They cook the grain which
is given <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb587" href="#pb587" name=
"pb587">587</a>]</span>to them on the tenth day of the festival, giving
a little to the Muhammadan priest and eating the rest. This observance
of a Muhammadan rite is no doubt due to their long association with
followers of that religion in Ber&#257;r.</p>

<h3 class="main">6. Superstitions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before beginning work for the day the
S&#257;lew&#257;r makes obeisance to his loom and implements, nor may
he touch them without having washed his face and hands. A woman must
not approach the loom during her periodical impurity, and if anybody
sneezes as work is about to be begun, they wait a little time to let
the ill luck pass off. In N&#257;gpur they believe that the posts to
which the ends of the loom are fastened have magical powers, and if any
one touches them with his leg he will get ulcers up to the knee. If a
woman steps on the <i>k&#363;chi</i> or loom-brush she is put out of
caste and a feast has to be given to the community before she is
readmitted. To cure inflammation in the eyes they take a piece of
plaited grass and wrap it round with cotton soaked in oil. Then it is
held before the sufferer&rsquo;s eyes and set on fire and the drops of
oil are allowed to fall into water, and as they get cold and congeal
the inflammation is believed to abate. Among some classes of Koshtis
the killing of a cat is a very serious offence, almost equivalent to
killing a cow. Even if a man touches a dead cat he has to give two
feasts and be fully purified. The sanctity of the cat among Hindus is
sometimes explained on the ground that it kills rats, which attract
snakes into the house. But the real reason is probably that primitive
people regard all domestic animals as sacred. The Koshti also reveres
the dog and jackal.</p>

<h3 class="main">7. Clothes, etc.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The S&#257;lew&#257;rs of the God&#257;vari tract wrap
a short rectangular piece of cloth round their head as a turban.
Formerly, Mr. Raghun&#257;th W&#257;man states, the caste had a
distinctive form of turban by which it could be recognised, but under
British administration these rules of dress are falling into abeyance.
A few of the S&#257;lew&#257;rs put on the sacred thread, but it is not
generally worn. S&#257;lew&#257;r women have a device representing a
half-moon tattooed on the forehead between the ends of the eyebrows;
the cheeks are marked with a small dot and the arms adorned with a
representation of the sacred <i>tulsi</i> or basil. <span class=

<h3 class="main">8. Social rules and status.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The caste eat flesh and fish and drink liquor, and in
the Mar&#257;tha Districts they will eat chickens like most castes of
this country. In Mandla they have recently prohibited the keeping of
fowls, under pain of temporary expulsion. Those who took food in
charity-kitchens during the famine of 1900 were readmitted to the
community with the penalty of shaving the beard and moustaches in the
case of a man, and cutting a few hairs from the head in that of a
woman. In Ber&#257;r the L&#257;d, Jain and Katghar Koshtis are all
strict vegetarians. The Koshtis employ Br&#257;hmans for their
ceremonies, but their social status is about on a level with the
village menials, below the cultivating castes. This, however, is a very
good position for weavers, as most of the weaving castes are
stigmatised as impure. But the Koshtis live in towns and not in
villages and weave the finer kinds of cloth for which considerable
skill is required, while in former times their work also yielded a good
remuneration. These facts probably account for their higher status;
similarly the T&#257;ntis or weavers of Bengal who produce the fine
muslins of Dacca, so famous in Mughal times, have obtained such a high
rank there that Br&#257;hmans will take water from their
hands;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e18275src" href="#xd21e18275" name=
"xd21e18275src">6</a> while the few T&#257;ntis who are found in the
Central Provinces are regarded as impure and are not touched. The caste
are of a turbulent disposition, perhaps on account of their
comparatively light work, which does not tire their bodies like
cultivation and other manual labour. One or two serious riots have been
caused by the Koshtis in recent years.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">9. Occupation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The standard occupation of the caste is the weaving of
the fine silk-bordered cloths which are universally worn on the body by
Br&#257;hmans and other well-to-do persons of the Mar&#257;tha country.
The cloth is usually white with borders of red silk. They dye their own
thread with lac or the flowers of the <i>pal&#257;s</i> tree (<i>Butea
frondosa</i>). The price of a pair of loin-cloths of this kind is Rs.
14, and of a pair of <i>dupattas</i> or shoulder-cloths Rs. 10, while
women&rsquo;s <i>s&#257;ris</i> also are made. Each colony of Koshtis
in a separate town usually only weave one kind of cloth of the size for
which their looms are made. The silk-bordered loin-cloths of Umrer and
Pauni are well known and are sent all over <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb589" href="#pb589" name=
"pb589">589</a>]</span>India. The export of hand-woven cloth from all
towns of the N&#257;gpur plain has been estimated at Rs. 5 lakhs a
year. The rich sometimes have the cloths made with gold lace borders.
The following account of the caste is given in Sir R. Craddock&rsquo;s
N&#257;gpur Settlement Report: &ldquo;The Koshti is an inveterate
grumbler, and indeed from his point of view he has a great deal to
complain of. On the one hand the price of raw cotton and the cost of
his living have increased very largely; on the other hand, the product
of his loom commands no higher price than it did before, and he cannot
rely on selling it when the market is slack. He cannot adapt himself to
the altered environment and clings to his loom. He dislikes rough
manual labour and alleges, no doubt with truth, that it deprives him of
the delicacy of touch needed in weaving the finer cloths. If prices
rise he is the first to be distressed, and on relief works he cannot
perform the requisite task and has to be treated with special
indulgence. The mills have been established many years in N&#257;gpur,
but very few of the older weavers have sought employment there. They
have begun to send their children, but work at home themselves, though
they really all use machine-spun yarn. The Koshtis are quarrelsome and
addicted to drink, and they have generally been the chief instigators
of grain riots when prices rise. They often marry several wives and
their houses swarm with a proportionate number of children. But
although the poorer members of the community are in struggling
circumstances and are put to great straits when prices of food rise,
those who turn out the fine silk-bordered work are fairly prosperous in
ordinary times.&rdquo;</p>
